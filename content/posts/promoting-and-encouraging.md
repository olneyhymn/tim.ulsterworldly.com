At the 2023 Presbytery Diaconal Summit hosted by the OPC Committee on Diaconal ministries, I spoke on how Presbytery Diaconal Committees can promote and encoruage diaconal work within their presbyteries.
My talk was later released on the Reformed Deacon podcast.

# Strengthening Diaconal Ministry Through Presbytery Committees

I've served as a deacon for ten years now, and fundamentally I'm here because I love Christ's church. I'm grateful he's called me to be part of it, and because I love his church, I love the government he's established—including the offices he's ordained. Deacons don't exist in isolation; we're part of Christ's body and what he's established for us.

While denominational committees serve important functions, Christ hasn't ordained these committees—he's given us our offices and the governments of our own congregations. That's our greatest calling. As committee members, we have an opportunity to serve and build up our local churches and diaconates through our Presbytery Diaconal Committees.

## The Current State

We're in an encouraging era. Our Reformed churches—the OPC and sister denominations—have a stronger emphasis on diaconates than has been true historically. There were periods when diaconates languished significantly, particularly in 19th century Scotland and the U.S. Our opportunity now is to maintain this momentum and push it forward.

[RC Reed](https://reformeddeacon.com/the-deacon/), a Southern Presbyterian writing in 1903, captured what good deacons can accomplish: "To avoid friction between members, to promote happy pastorates, to develop the grace of liberality, nothing is more important than a good deacon—one who can be patient, one who can smile at unreasonable people and speak a soft word to turn away wrath, one who is willing to give time and take trouble on himself and make himself all things to all men in order to promote the interest of his master's cause."

This has been true in my experience. Diaconates have opportunities to promote peace and happiness in congregations. When there's conflict, the session is often involved in disagreements, but deacons can promote peace through those times. There's an analogy here: presbytery diaconal committees have opportunities to promote peace and unity across presbyteries.

## Why Presbyteries Need Diaconal Promotion and Coordination

Consider the Presbytery of the Southeast. We have 32 congregations or mission works—23 congregations and 9 mission works. Twelve have no deacons. That's a third of our congregations. Three have solo deacons, which presents its own significant challenges. Some have aging deacons serving into their 80s. Some have rookie deacons without experienced mentors around them. Some have pastors and sessions who don't know how to train and equip their deacons.

Critically, deacons lack a natural system for connecting with deacons from other churches. They don't have something like presbytery where they inevitably fellowship with brothers from other congregations. The Committee on Diaconal Ministries has worked toward this through summits, but Presbytery Diaconal Committees can fill this gap as well.

I started seeing this possibility in 2015 when our committee organized a conference. It had never occurred to me to think about diaconal work in a broader, connectional, Presbyterian way before that event. That conference led me to join the Presbytery Diaconal Committee six months later.

## Practical Steps for PDCs

**Don't try to implement everything immediately.** Write down a couple things you want to try. Keep your notes so you can revisit them in a couple years and add more.

### Promote CDM Resources

Think about how to promote Committee on Diaconal Ministries resources throughout your presbytery. Make efforts to get your men to diaconal summits—pick up the phone and call deacons directly. The summit archives on the website contain video and audio from all summits and are excellent training resources, especially the 2022 content. Promote the Reformed Deacon podcast, which produces content unavailable anywhere else.

Let local diaconates know the CDM has financial resources to help when congregations can't meet needs. Not everyone knows this—you're always getting new deacons, so keep putting this information in front of people.

### Maintain a Diaconal Registry

This is a really good place to start. Our bylaws required it, but it hadn't been updated when I became chairman. You can't just do it once—you have to keep pestering local pastors or clerks of sessions for updates. We maintain ours in a spreadsheet with a shared link on our private presbytery website, accessible to presbyters at any time. We also send it periodically to our deacons.

It's been fruitful for multiple reasons. We assign each of our five committee members to specific congregations, creating direct points of contact. This matters for disaster response and routine communication.

### Make Yourself Available and Known

I've tried to make myself available to officers of our presbytery. Our bylaws require us to report on financial expenses, so I'm at every presbytery meeting. My work allows this flexibility, but even if your chairman can't attend, have somebody else report. You need to be reporting to presbytery.

I want the men of our presbytery to know who I am, what our committee is, and what we can offer. When they have needs extending beyond their congregation, I want them to think of us. My report often repeats the same things every meeting: we're here, we're available, here are our names and phone numbers, this is what we can offer.

It's paid off. One session asked me to speak with their deacons in training—a great opportunity that happened because the minister knew me from presbytery. We need to remind presbyters that the committee can help with financial needs and that even when presbyteries can't help, the CDM may be able to.

We've switched to written reports covering the different things our standing rules require. I now share these reports with the deacons of the presbytery as well.

**Critical: you need to be responsive when requests come.** Don't let emails sit for weeks. Even if you need to convene your committee before responding, let people know you've seen their request. If you're not responsive, they won't bother trying again.

### Host Diaconal Conferences

We've had success with presbytery-wide conferences. Our 2015 conference was formative for me. We did another in 2018 with 20-30 men attending. Some drove 10-12 hours across our presbytery.

We invited Nick Wilborn, a PCA minister and church historian who loves the diaconate, as guest speaker. His talks are on the CDM website and Sermon Audio. This doesn't have to be expensive—we did it for under $2,000. The CDM has helped with funding. Deacons have low expectations.

Invite ministers and elders too. Not many attended ours, but they benefit from this content just like at the National Diaconal Summit.

We've discussed doing smaller regional gatherings instead of presbytery-wide events, putting most people within three or four hours' drive instead of seven. We haven't executed this yet, but it's worth considering.

It's not rocket science: reserve hotel rooms, get church ladies to coordinate meals, line up speakers. Speakers don't need to be fancy—your pastor and a couple deacons work fine.

### Prepare for Disaster Response

PDCs should take the lead here. In 2011, tornadoes hit Alabama and Virginia. A church in Chilhowie, Virginia had significant property damage. Our committee was totally unprepared. The responsibility fell on the minister to coordinate response, which isn't how it should work. That was an eye-opener.

Disaster response efforts have undoubtedly unified and strengthened our presbytery. Men work together through hurricanes and floods. These efforts witness to congregations—people new to Presbyterianism see brothers coming from all over the country to help.

Different places have different risks. We focus on hurricane preparedness, but because we maintain our registry and have prepared committee members, we're ready for other disasters too. When we hear about storms or flooding, our committee contacts pastors or deacons the next day asking about impact.

The CDM and the disaster response coordinator are ready to assist. Every presbytery faces some risk—flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, storms. Your PDC should be the first response outside the local congregation.

It means a lot to local deacons when someone from their committee reaches out because they were paying attention and knew where you lived when a storm hit the news.

### Be Proactive and Prepared

Much diaconal work is reactive—we wait for things to happen. But you need to be prepared for those things. Does your committee know how it will process financial requests? Think through being ready for those situations.

### Additional Opportunities

**Engage with retired ministers and widows.** Everyone does Obadiah Fund calls, but I want to see local deacons engaged with retired ministers, encouraging and supporting them. Even if a retired minister isn't at their congregation, if they're in the geographic vicinity, it's appropriate for deacons to know them and take them to lunch annually.

**Joint work days.** Some presbyteries have done joint work on building projects. That's excellent fellowship—working beside someone while you chat is a great way to connect. Even in geographically spread presbyteries, people might drive a couple hours for a Saturday project.

**Meet local deacons at presbytery meetings.** One PDC tries to meet with deacons from the congregation hosting presbytery. I attend our meetings and hop around to different congregations, but this never crossed my mind. It's a great way to understand local needs and make sure deacons know about your committee.

## Ongoing Challenges

I'm thinking through how to better engage Mission Works and congregations without deacons. Where that responsibility falls on the session, we've maybe dropped the ball. We track these congregations in our registry, but when there are no phone numbers to call, it creates a gap. We need to maintain at least one contact at all those congregations and check in with them about serving diaconal needs even without deacons.

**Diaconal training** is another ongoing need. This is one of the main requests the CDM gets: how can we train deacons? Many pastors get minimal instruction about deacons in seminary. Some are fortunate to have diaconal experience before becoming ministers, but many don't have a great sense of how to train deacons. As your committee becomes known, you'll get this question. Have some kind of answer. My number one recommendation: get Cornelius Van Damme's book *The Deacon* and go through it. Point people to opccdm.org—there are many good resources there.

## The Value of Presence

Not everyone's work allows this, but being present at presbytery meetings has value beyond delivering reports. You get face time with ministers and elders. They become familiar with you and you with them. You get a sense of who men are and how they work—information that will inform how you minister to them when the time comes.

At our last presbytery meeting, the schedule ran long and our report got cut. I wasn't even there. But a minister I don't know well commented on Facebook that he missed seeing me at presbytery. That was encouraging—he noticed I wasn't there. This committee has a place in the presbytery, and making that visible matters.

Our presbytery diaconal committees exist to promote, encourage, and coordinate diaconal work. The goal is building up our local churches and local diaconates. That's the calling Christ has given us.

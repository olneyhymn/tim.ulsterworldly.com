A timely episode from the [OPC Committee on Diaconal Ministries](https://opccdm.org) podcast on an important topic for deacons caring for seniors in their congregations: helping them recognize and avoid scams.

As deacons, we are often among the first to interact with vulnerable members of our flock, including seniors who are increasingly targeted by financial scammers. This episode provides practical guidance on how to help protect those under our care.

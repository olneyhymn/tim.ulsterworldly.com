Since starting Waiting Tables, my wife had our first baby, I started a new job, and I took on some new responsibilities at our church. This hasn't left enough time in the week for me to continue doing the bi-weekly podcast. I hope and pray that people will continue to benefit from the podcast archives, and I hope to continue it in the future.

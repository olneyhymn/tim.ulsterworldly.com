I had the privilege of speaking to the 6th [Presbytery Diaconal Summit](https://www.opccdm.org/summits) of the OPC Committee on Diaconal Ministries. This event brings together the presbytery diaconal committees from across the OPC, which serve to provide diaconal care for ministers, support and encourage local diaconates, financially support needs that local diaconates can't meet, and more. 

I spoke on the topic of "Reforming our Relationships." The focus of my talk was [2 Corinthians 8–9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%208–9&version=ESV), where Paul speaks to the Corinthians about bringing to completion the task he gave in [1 Corinthians 16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2016%3A1-3&version=NIV) to send aid to the Christians in Jerusalem.

Here's an outline of my talk:

1. Regional Cooperation in Mercy: The churches of Macedonia and Corinth united to meet the needs of believers in Jerusalem. (8:1, 8:
2. Giving as a Work of Grace: Generosity flows from God's grace and is an administration of God's grace. (8:1, 8:6, 8:19; 9:8)
3. The Root of Diaconal Ministry: Christ's self-giving love is the foundation of all Christian mercy. (8:9)
4. Growth in the Gift of Liberality: Churches can be encouraged and challenged to excel in graces, including generosity. (8:7)
5. The Power of Example: Sharing the story of the Macedonians' eagerness to give stirs others to similar zeal. Diaconal Committees do the same in sharing in the work of our churches. (8:4; 9:2)
6. Demonstrating Earnest Care: Our partner churches should sense our genuine concern for them, as Paul and Titus modeled. (8:16)
7. Completing the Work: We must bring good intentions to completion even when the work is difficult. (8:11)
8. Building Trust in Shared Ministry: Diaconal work across distance, like that of the PDCs, requires trusted servants and transparent stewardship. (8:20--22)
9. Sowing Bountifully and Cheerfully: Generous giving is both commanded and commended; we are to encourage it in others as well. (9:6--8)
10. Giving Produces Thanksgiving: Material gifts overflow in praise and gratitude to God. (9:12--13)
11. The Fruit of Fellowship: Generosity fosters mutual prayer, affection, and joy among believers. (9:14)
12. The Ultimate Gift: All Christian giving points to God's inexpressible gift in Christ. (9:15)

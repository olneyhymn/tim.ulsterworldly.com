*Waiting Tables Episode 5 with Joe Gallant*

{{< audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/waitingtables-media.com/audio/episode-5-with-joe-gallant.mp3" >}}

I speak with Joe Gallant of [churchtrain.uk](http://churchtrain.uk), a consultant agency for "Equipping UK churches and volunteers to communicate effectively".

Joe helps church leaders think about improving their communications, especially focused on church communications in a digital age.

Joe suggests that churches should ask three basic questions about all their communications:

1. What are you saying?
2. What are they hearing?
3. How should you say it?

These seem basic and straightforward, yet many church leaders don't step back to reflect on them. This can result in communications being ineffective and confusing.

Listen to Joe and I talk about what these questions can help you direct your church communications efforts to help you effectively present yourself to your desired audience and represent your church in an authentic way.

## Transcript

**Tim Hopper:** Of the Waiting Tables podcast. I'm here with a special guest, Mr. Joe Gallant. Joe is a church communications consultant in the United Kingdom. He advises churches on communication strategy, social media, graphic design, website and blog strategy, event promotion, and more. As those of you who have listened to the podcast know, these have been near and dear to Waiting Tables as we're getting started. And I'm interested in hearing Joe's perspective and hearing about his work and how he can help people. If you'd like to find out more about Joe, you can check out his website at churchtrain.uk, and he has a church communications blog there that would be great to follow as you strive to learn more about these things and improve on them at your own church. Welcome, Joe.

**Joe Gallant:** Hi. I appreciate you answering my email coming from a stranger asking you to come be on my podcast.

**Tim Hopper:** Absolutely. You're the first British guest, so that's a great honor, I hope.

**Joe Gallant:** I am honored indeed. Tell us, what does church communications mean to you? What do you think of when you talk about that?

**Joe Gallant:** Sure. I mean, that's an obvious first question to ask, and you'd think it'd be an easy one. But honestly, I think that church communications is such a broad thing.

I tend to include lots of things within church. The definition but but mainly i'd say anything any way that we try to pass a message from our church to someone in our audience um and that's obviously going to include you know channels like your your church website or social media as i know you've thought about before on the podcast yep um but it's also going to relate to to things which are completely not digital like posters or flyers, or even the PowerPoint slides you show in your services. I know you've spoken before about the notice board. So really, any way that we as a church are seeking to reach out to and communicate with people in our audience, I bring that under church communications.

**Tim Hopper:** And it seems, you know, in a way, in a very real way, communications is fundamental to us as Christians and us as churches. You know, sermons are an obvious thing that a sermon is communication. But even from the very beginning, in the Bible, we have written word, right? And so that's a form of communication.

**Joe Gallant:** For sure, yeah.

**Tim Hopper:** From the very beginning, people were trying to schedule a time to meet together, right? And so it requires communications. And probably arguing over what time to meet as well.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah, but it's a very encompassing thing. And it's something that, obviously, as humans, we just communicate. By our nature, but it's also something we can think about doing well and improving on, right? It's just, just the way that we always naturally do it isn't necessarily the best way.

**Joe Gallant:** That's it. Yeah. I think that, um, you know, communication in itself, as you say, it comes naturally to us. Um, and you know, we'll, we'll do it all the time throughout our day. Um, but that's not necessarily the same thing as communicating on behalf of a church or a business. And it needs a bit more practical thought behind it to be intentional I guess

**Tim Hopper:** So on that note, what motivated you to think about helping churches with their communication?

**Joe Gallant:** I think for me, it was mainly the social media and the design side and those are things that I'm passionate about I guess video as well my background is video production and.

I just saw a lot of churches who were trying, but not doing very well. And it's not about being critical, but there are things I noticed they could be doing better. And part of that was almost like a language thing that I think with younger people, especially, you grow up using social media and it becomes like a language that you learn. And then, you know, your parents or your grandparents go on it. And there's just this awkward tension that that's not their first language. And there's some awkwardness there. And sometimes the church can come across like that.

So, yeah, I realized that there were things which were almost second nature to me that I could share with churches and hopefully help them to do it well as well.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, yeah. And I'll tell you, having been involved with the social media for my own church, it's hard. And one of the wild things is it's just constantly changing, right? Our mediums are changing so much faster than ever before.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. I read a blog post just this morning that was called, Why Can't Marketers Have Nice Things? And it was all about the fact that every new marketing trend is jumped on by people, and we use it to death, and therefore it changes. And we have to keep up with that, even if we're not responsible for it.

**Tim Hopper:** Right. In the UK, do you have churches that have the letterboard signs outside where they put silly things on their signs?

**Joe Gallant:** Not so much. You get some cheesy posters for sure. But the letterboard thing, I think that's more of a US thing. That's not quite made its way over here.

**Tim Hopper:** I mean, some of them are just so laughably bad.

**Joe Gallant:** But to the person who put it there, that's a great idea. and they're doing that with sincerity and... It's maybe just not working in the way they think it is right and then the the i don't i don't know if they're i guess newer churches they're probably not as common anymore but i remember in my childhood um i'm from the american south where churches are just on every corner and you drive around and you you see and they're just so bad but now the the social media has allowed us to do equally bad things but to show them to the entire world right absolutely.

The audience is just bigger so there's maybe uh it's worth even thinking about more carefully

**Joe Gallant:** yeah i mean the audience is bigger and it's also a lot quicker and easier to do as well it doesn't take someone you know a couple of hours to go out there and change that sign with a message which they've thought up you can just type something out and hit send and you know whatever ramifications may come from that you're not necessarily thinking about it it's uh it's a blessing and a curse

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, definitely. It's easy so you can get it out there and it's easy so you can say really foolish or stupid or just unclear things even before you realize it. We just had a situation at my church a few weeks ago where one of our elders announced an event that was happening. Left everyone in the church confused about what was actually happening.

**Joe Gallant:** Because just the, it didn't come across the way he had it in his mind. It didn't come across.

**Tim Hopper:** That's it. That's it. We've been talking like, how do we, even just in the morning announcements, how do we do that more clearly and be articulate there?

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. I mean, that's, that's just the nature of communication, isn't it? Is that it's complex. And it really requires interaction from both you as if you like the originator of the message but also the recipient as well and you've got to try and see yourself in their shoes as to how the message is going to be taken as well as how you're saying it.

**Tim Hopper:** I think that's such an important point in learning to communicate well as I try to learn how to communicate well you can't just to think what makes sense to me, but you really do have to be able to be empathetic and understand how it's going to be perceived and understood.

**Joe Gallant:** I think one of the challenges with particularly electronic communication is thinking about who our audience is can be quite hard, right? So if you hand out a bulletin in your church, you might expect, you have some idea of who's going to actually see that and who your audience is focused to. But one of the things to think about with a church social media page, for example, is your audience your congregation or is your audience your local community?

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Joe Gallant:** Who may or may not be Christians or may or may not be in your church or is it the whole world? And I know that's something you mentioned in your social media episode.

**Tim Hopper:** Obviously, there's that distinction between within the church and not within the church.

**Joe Gallant:** And it may be that for some messages there's going to be quite a large area of crossover that you know if you're doing a social event you want to advertise it and inform the people in your church about what's going on as as much as you do to those that you you want to invite to it from outside of the church but then there's obviously times when there's more of an internal nature to the communications if you're sharing prayer requests or something like that how might that come across to the public, would you even want it shared with the public if it's these private things? And it's hard to find a balance there and maybe use different tools for different parts of your audience as well.

**Tim Hopper:** Right.

**Tim Hopper:** So you provide a service to churches where you help them think through these things. And we've already answered this a little bit, but can you give us a little bit of your sales pitch? If you're sitting down with the church and trying to suggest to them that they should they should think about having someone help them with their communications why what's your uh your best pitch that you think it's a valuable thing

**Joe Gallant:** sure as we've already said that communications is absolutely integral to the gospel it's integral to christianity you know we we have all heard about jesus through someone else telling us um in whatever form that is so i think it's 100 100 essential that we communicate um but then the question is how do we do this and i think for some people there's there's this difficulty which creeps in when we.

I don't think many Christians are going to argue that evangelism is a bad thing. But when we start throwing about words like Twitter and Snapchat, then it's hard for people to see, you know, the crossover between those things, which are very much the world, and then, you know, God's message for people.

Which, you know, I think that's often more about a resistance to change than any theological issues, although they're often packed up as, you know, spiritual sounding arguments nonetheless. Less um but at the end of the day we're called to spread the gospel and in my mind i believe that we should use whichever means we can um to do this um that obviously then requires knowing about all of the different methods which are out there um and as you say it's a really fast changing world um in terms of communications in terms of marketing and um you know we we have a bit of a responsibility to keep up with that so that we can try and communicate as best as possible to.

Different people

**Tim Hopper:** yeah yeah so you talk on your website uh then about three questions which are really simple questions uh around communications uh but i think are a really helpful uh starting point those are what are you saying what are they hearing and how should you say it you know you look at that you say okay yeah that's all obvious but uh it seems that it really takes an effort to actually step back and think about that as we're actually doing a particular communications project or uh delivery so can we talk through those a little bit what are we what are we asking what are what are you saying

**Joe Gallant:** yes as you say these are basic questions to really get get people thinking and to sort of prompt discussion.

But as you say, it's hard to take that time out as well. And it's one of those things that... When you're really busy, you don't want to make time to sort of do these bigger picture tasks. But in the long run, it informs what you're doing.

**Tim Hopper:** Right. We don't have time to stop and think, what are we saying? We have to say something, right?

**Joe Gallant:** Exactly. Exactly. We have to hit send before someone else does or before people stop listening.

**Tim Hopper:** Exactly. It sounds silly, but that is so real.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah, it is. So what are you saying? It's a common sense question that we need to think before we talk. And so instead of just creating a bunch of texts that we publish on our website, for example, we need to just spend a little bit of time thinking about what we want to achieve. So what message are we actually trying to get across to people in this instance? And then how does that fit into the larger vision of the church? And I think the vision as well as branding are two things which really link in with what I do with church communications. And we haven't got too much time to go into the real details of that. But I think that your church vision and your brand make up who you are as a church and then inform all of the decisions you make over the strategy.

So whilst you can go into minuscule detail when we're talking about brand guidelines or star guidelines, as you mentioned in your graphic design episode, I think a really easy way to think about this what are you saying part is does this message sound like our church? And you may need to have a rethink about either what you're saying or how you're saying it.

**Tim Hopper:** That's really helpful. Can you, to not take everything, all your bags of tricks or to go for hours, can you maybe give us a brief overview of what do you mean when you say vision and what do you mean when you say brand?

**Joe Gallant:** Sure. I mean, churches can spend endless hours and hours going back over and revisiting their vision. And I know some people who do it every six months. but essentially what you know what is the big picture what is the goal of your church and And that's not going to be 100% different for every church, because we have, you know, things that the Bible tells us that should be our priorities.

But we're all going to have a different interest and a different heart. You know, that might be based on your community and the types of people that you, you know, are going to interact with in your community. But it's that driving force behind all that you do. And it may be that you know every single tweet doesn't directly relate to that vision but i think that every every point that you put out on on your communications will indirectly it will be an outworking of that vision yeah i really think branding um goes hand in hand with that um so obviously your your brand as a church is bigger than just the branding of your your logo and your colors or even the just the style of voice that you use um but those things do all link together to show your vision and with branding i i like to use this idea of touch points that that every time that an audience member interacts with your brand is a different touch point a different chance for them to experience who you are as a church

**Tim Hopper:** i've been thinking about this idea of a brand and kind of style since talking to Matt on the last episode.

And I'd made the comment, you know, some people, Christians and church leaders would be hesitant to start talking in that language. That's very businessy language. That's really real. And Matt had particularly suggested, you know, as an organization, you should think about having a style guide. And that's not something we've done at my church. And I could see there being people pushing back against even the idea, like having a church style guide. And then what occurred to me is –.

In some ways, we do have a style guide, and a lot of it is in my head. I do a lot of the communications for my church. And so I try to communicate things in a particular way and format things in a particular way and present things in a particular way. And at times I might say, no, I don't want this other person to do this project because they wouldn't do it my way, which is effectively according to my style guide.

**Joe Gallant:** Sure. So there may be some strength in putting that down on paper, but at the same time, the fact that you've already got it in your head... It's a lot easier than if you're just approaching it from scratch and saying, you know, for a complete style guide, where do we go? You've already got a voice at church, which is established, you know.

**Tim Hopper:** Right. And I guess my point is more broadly that in some sense, everyone has a style guide.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. Everyone has a brand.

**Tim Hopper:** Yes. Are you doing it intentionally and are you trying to do it well or are you just doing whatever? However.

**Joe Gallant:** It's almost unavoidable in some ways. Just as far as everyone is communicating, whether or not we want to talk about – we have a communications director.

**Tim Hopper:** Right. We're all communicating. And so with that, we have a way and a voice and a style that we're acting with.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah, definitely. And it's not the most important thing for a church, but when we're able, it's worth reflecting on.

**Tim Hopper:** Definitely, because I think part of the resistance to branding is that it's almost like we're trying to compete with other churches.

**Joe Gallant:** Right. But the reality is that everyone is competing in this world. And I'm not talking about trying to get someone to come to your church to win them over rather than going to the church down the road. I'm talking about getting them to come to your Facebook page as opposed to, you know, the next brand or the next Instagram product page. And if our branding doesn't reflect the life which is actually in our church, then people aren't going to pay attention. Perhaps it's a sad thing.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. People are visual and especially, you know, in the digital age, they're very visual mediums. I can't think of much worse than, you know, churches who have this really relevant message, but people just aren't hearing it because they're not putting the time or effort into what are actually, at the end of the day, fairly simple things, such as communications, branding and vision, but just need that time out to actually consider it and think about it.

**Tim Hopper:** Going back to this question of what are you saying, say you haven't thought before about your vision and branding and how that reflects on your communications. What are some first steps a church can take to think about what are they saying as they communicate?

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah, and this is something that I often do as part of the workshops that I do with churches. And that's just to to think about again not going back to that idea of competition but what makes your church different from the church down the road right um not to not to try and you know win them over or get one over them but these are things which define your church congregation and they're often going to be things which are actually really attractive to the world um that you're going to have you know family values or you're going to really care for the youth or the elderly and and these are things which are really appealing um, So it's not about, you know, creating a vision from scratch, as we said with the style guide. It's about looking at what you're doing and who you are and just getting that down into, you know, some bullet points or just half a page of text or something. Because I think that will really help you to then make those further decisions that we can go on to talk about when you've got this identity that you're rooted in.

**Tim Hopper:** And that's hard work. You know, half a page of text sounds easy. But once you start to sit down and really think about that, that, yeah, definitely, definitely.

**Joe Gallant:** It's good to do it with other people. It's good to get, you know, people from different, um, demographics, if you like different ages into the room to talk about what the church means to them and to compare and contrast.

**Joe Gallant:** But then ultimately, the vision is set by the leadership of the church as well.

**Joe Gallant:** So it's down to them to combine it onto a piece of paper.

**Tim Hopper:** So your first question is, what are you saying? And then the second is, what are they hearing? And why are those different? I mean, isn't what you're trying to say what people always hear?

**Joe Gallant:** You'd hope, wouldn't you? It would be nice. I think for me, this goes right back to that idea of putting yourself in your audience's shoes. Um and i think there are two levels here as well so first of all are they actually hearing your message um if you're not using the right methods of communication then they might not be hearing it or reading it at all um so if you have a lot of young people and families using instagram for example consider is this really the best channel to use when you're advertising your elderly people's ministry um probably not um whereas on the other hand facebook might be um as as you talked about on the previous episode that um that's the the fastest growing demographic on facebook is is the older people so that might be great for for reaching them and then maybe consider some print publicity as well for those who aren't online um so that's about you know using the right channel so that they can hear it full stop but then secondly if the message does actually.

Reach them get through to them are you doing all that you can to ensure that that they're not misunderstanding what you're saying or that they're not getting the wrong impression of who you are um going back to that vision um and and i think that relates it can go both ways but it relates to integrity and and not trying to come across as something you're not but also um, not going the other way and not coming across as something that you are right

**Tim Hopper:** yeah our uh i was just saying to our pastor the other day that i i do a lot of the sending out email announcements and things for our church and and sometimes instead of sending people will send something to me that they want to go out to the church and instead of a particular email that it's just copy and paste they just give me the general idea this is what i want to say yeah and uh i spend a lot of time thinking about that and actually turning that into the into the email that we're sending out.

**Tim Hopper:** And i mean not to just scare people off from all this but um, This is also hard work, right? Thinking about what people are hearing.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. Really just take stepping back and thinking through and not just type out the first thing that comes to mind and press the send button.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah. And it does take effort, but it pays off as well because you can see if the messages are getting through to people, then you want to see more bums on seats. You want to see more people coming to know Christ at the end of the day.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. And I think that's the end goal.

**Tim Hopper:** In a shorter term, I was sharing with my pastor also a theory that as you communicate well, you have this snowball effect where you really have people more engaged in what you're communicating because they have the expectation that you're going to communicate well.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. So if they've been able to take in and process and benefit from what they're hearing from you, they're going to continue to expect that.

**Tim Hopper:** Whereas I think you can set a negative pattern where if you're confusing and overly wordy and you use terrible fonts or all these different things, then you're setting an expectation that this is not something I'm going to spend my time on.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah, definitely. And I think that there's a comparison there in two ways that you can compare yourself to, you know, the other brands that they're interacting with on social media on a day to day basis. And if you're the one who is coming across as boring, or as unprofessional, then that's going to show up. But then also, if you as a church are doing a good job, and are spending some time and effort on this, then it's, That's probably going to be quite different to their expectation of how a church usually sounds.

**Joe Gallant:** It's like, not to bring style too much into it, but it's like if you've been brought up in a very, very traditional church, and then you suddenly go into the most charismatic sort of rock concert-like church and completely blows your expectations away. Now, whether one is right or wrong or different from the other one, you're going to pay a lot more attention if it's different from what your expectations were.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah. So you can really have a positive effect by doing that. I think.

**Tim Hopper:** That's interesting. Your third question then is how should you say it? What are you getting at by that question?

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. So it's, it's not so much how, how should you say it in terms of what words you're using? Um, I think that was covered in the previous point that we talked about, but it's more, how should you go about doing it um and and this is actually something i'm i'm passionate about um because we have limited resources as churches a lot of the time so we really need to think carefully about how we spend our time how we spend our money and and actually our people as well and we need to be really careful not to overburden our staff and volunteers not to overwork them because we've got a responsibility to them and so bringing this back into our communications.

We can have everything right in terms of our content strategy we're using the right channels um we're contacting the right people with the right messages but if we haven't spent time thinking about how to how to do this in the most efficient way then it's probably not going to be sustainable for the long term and if it is it may be that we're actually crushing the volunteers that we've tasked right to do this um so this is all about using the right tools so that we can manage these processes so that we've got plans in place, whether that's delegating that to different people or whether it's different software that can make our lives easier with scheduling or just organization and task management, things like that. But I think it comes down to stewarding our resources wisely.

And a huge part, which I'd love to, you know, spend days talking about, is just focus and prioritizing and realizing that we may not be able to do everything.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah.

**Joe Gallant:** That we'll have to choose which areas to focus on. But personally, I'd much rather have a couple of areas done really well that are reaching people effectively than have loads and loads of, like a scattergun effect of different social networks and everything that aren't doing their job.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, I think that's really wise. So you provide a training services to churches in the United Kingdom. Can you tell us a little bit more about how that works and what you provide?

**Joe Gallant:** Yes, I usually go and spend three or four hours with a group that might be the staff team, or it might be the volunteers who are involved with the communications.

And we just think through these questions and we think through what does it look like to have our vision on a piece of paper and then how does that inform everything else that we do? We think about the problem areas of their current communications processes, which sometimes they may not even up to that point have recognized they have communications processes. Because that might just be someone sends out an email every week and someone else puts together the bulletin, the news sheet to hand out on Sunday. But we look at the points there which may be taking up time, may be taking up people's efforts, but aren't necessarily having a huge effect and try and focus, try and prioritize.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah, so it's good fun.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah. And do you do follow-ups or?

**Joe Gallant:** Something that I do as a matter of course is just, you know, catch up and find out how it's going and then stay in touch and hopefully offer any other useful advice, but also gather feedback from what's working for them that I can pass on to other churches and share with them as well.

**Tim Hopper:** Right. Yeah, that's one of the motivations for this podcast, as I've mentioned before, is so many of these issues –, transcend our denominational distinctives.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Tim Hopper:** To where I feel like in my own church, I'm often reinventing the wheel.

**Tim Hopper:** I just, I've wanted other people who I can go and ask questions about these kinds of things. And how are you doing this? What have you thought about for this? And even if it, if the application doesn't look a hundred percent the same in our different contexts or countries or denominations, I think there are just a lot of common foundations.

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah, definitely. I've got a page on the site. If you go to church train.uk forward slash resources, then there's some links to other people who are saying helpful things with communication. And I've been careful to include not just Christian resources as well, because there's a lot of stuff we can learn. I think your guest before talking about graphic design talked about keeping an eye on the pros. That's not just relevant for you know the current design trends but the current communication trends as well to see what's changing what are people doing well what are people recommending.

And so yeah church train.uk forward slash resources has some links there and i've definitely need to be adding this podcast to the to the list as well

**Tim Hopper:** thank you i appreciate that and i'll link to that at waiting-tables.com i'm putting you on the spot here a little bit because I didn't put this on my outline that I sent to you, but are there any books on church communications that you find particularly valuable?

**Joe Gallant:** Yeah. I mean, there's a book, which I believe is published by Church Marketing Sucks, but don't quote me on that because I might be wrong. They're a great resource as well. And the book is called Unwelcome. And that's not just about, you know, online communications. A lot of it is about whether people are feeling welcomed as they come in through the door. But I think a lot of it carries over with the online and the offline um.

Worlds emerging there um and another book as well which which isn't at all specific to churches but i've found really helpful for just thinking about branding and communications in a different way um it's called brand thinking and and that's um it's put together by debbie millman um who who runs um uh design matters is is a is a twitter chat um but it's it's interviews with all of these marketing and branding and design experts. And it's absolutely fascinating, but can really just help you think about communicating in a different way on a deeper level.

**Tim Hopper:** That's great. And another, I'm just bringing them out of left field for you now, but do you know of anyone doing similar work to what you're doing in the States that is offering a similar kind of service?

**Joe Gallant:** I don't know about the in-person stuff and the workshops.

**Joe Gallant:** I'm sure that there there are people one name that springs to mind um as someone who who writes stuff um and also um manages a facebook group as well which is really helpful is katie allred um and and i'm sure i can give you a link to put that up on the on the show page um.

Um and and she manages a facebook group um which i think is just called church communications but it's really a forum for people to share ideas and ask questions and and it's quite active um so that would be a really useful place um and i know there are a couple of events in the u.s as well um a conference type events around around this um one one of them being um that church conference which i think is fairly new i think it's maybe um only taken place once or twice um but that's run by justin dean who used to be um i think he's head of pr at mars hill okay so that's worth taking a look at as well

**Tim Hopper:** yeah very good those are all news to me so that's that's really helpful information one last uh surprise question here for you we talked about the social media and technology space changing so fast are there trends or things that you see coming up in the in the future uh that you're keeping an eye on that you know we've talked a lot uh here about twitter and facebook uh as big social networks but are there other things that i mean it's it's not massively new but the thing that everyone's talking about is video obviously you can do that a lot easier these days um than than you used to be able to.

It maybe goes back to that you know marketers aren't allowed nice things um because it's going to be overused and eventually it won't be effective but at the same time if video is effective at the moment and you can produce it fairly easily then that's worth doing um and one thing we've um we've started doing recently um so so we live stream our sermons and have done for quite a while um but we've just started using facebook live at some of our other community events so beach baptisms and we had a you know a fun day um and using facebook and twitter or whoever it is using using their own tools rather than going through like youtube and embedding it um will get much more reach on the networks um doing it natively because they want to promote their own tools um the the other thing which which is getting bigger is is messaging and message bots and obviously you can spend loads and loads of time on that but i think that the key thing to learn from that is that one-to-one communication is really valuable i've found in the past that whilst it takes quite a bit of effort and maybe that's an understatement um it's really worth taking the time where you can to just message people individually even.

If even if that's a fairly templated message just changing it so it's relevant to the person that you're that you're talking to um can have a really big impact um i've got one one blog post on church train which is.

Something about um stop failing at facebook events um that it's it's great to have an event page on your facebook as you've mentioned before um but if it only has two people who have clicked attending on it then it's as if only two people are coming right right so a great way to get around that is for those people within the church that you know are going to be coming just to remind them of that and then directly ask them go and click attending and if they do that that makes a big difference to the people that you're not able to then message directly as well.

**Tim Hopper:** Right. Yes.

**Joe Gallant:** But at the end of the day, communication is a two way thing. And, and we want to be hearing from people as well as just, you know, we don't want to be just shouting at them.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Tim Hopper:** That's really helpful. I, I, uh, I'm really glad you're thinking about these things. And, um, I'm glad you mentioned video. That's something I would like to, uh, talk about more on waiting tables in the future. It's something I've, uh, gotten into a little bit in our own church and it's, it's easier than ever and cheaper than ever, but it is still hard to do well, I think.

Uh, so I'll have, uh, hopefully more content on that in the future. And if anyone is hearing this and would like to come on and talk about it, you can send me an email at tim at waiting dash tables.com. Uh, Joe, unless you have any final words, I will, uh, wrap it up with you anything more you'd like to add

**Joe Gallant:** i think just to re-emphasize that thing of listening to your people um and and maybe just as a really practical point to to finish on um it's just doing a

*Waiting Tables Episode 10 with Josh Navey*

{{< audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/waitingtables-media.com/audio/ep-10-navey.mp3" >}}

In this episode, I speak with Josh Navey, children's pastor at Summit. He is involved in ministering to the children of Summit, from birth to the fourth grade level.

Three different kinds of child safety are discussed in this episode:

1. Physical Safety at Church from Intruders
2. Sexual Abuse Prevention
3. Safety from Natural Disasters and Fire

Child abuse is the #1 reason that churches are taken to court.

Having a child safety policy in place, even if you are a small church, is important. Look online for child safety policies. In some cases, if insurance companies see that you have a policy in place, it could affect your rates positively, depending on what that policy is.

Two important things to enforce when allowing workers to interact with the children:

* Background checks on all workers 18 years and older. Accufax and other companies can do background checks for you. Make sure these checks are updated every 3-5 years. Be aware that there are rules on how the background check reports can be stored properly; the company you choose to run the checks should be able to help you so this properly.
* 2 adult rule: No one is ever left alone with any child/children. Even if there is only one child needing care, two adults must accompany at all times.

Consider the design of your building and how it affects child safety. Some recommendations include:

* Making sure every full door has a window in it.
* Using Dutch style doors that keep the children in, keep those outside fenced away from the children, but allow visual access to the room is a great practice.

Also, have a secure system for making sure each child is reunited with the correct adult.

How can parents work to keep their children safe?

* Serve in the children's ministry!
* Teach kids about their bodies.
* Joyfully honor and respect the rules in place at your church. Be aware that lacking a cheerful spirit in doing so says that the workers enforcing the rules care more about your child's welfare than you do.

To prepare for an emergency situation like an active shooter intruding, a natural disaster, or a fire, make sure that each room is equipped with a map detailing an exit plan. Make sure that the workers know that it is there.

## Transcript

**Tim Hopper:** For the first time ever, a local guest, Mr. Josh Navy, who is the kids pastor at Summit Church here in the Raleigh area. Though we are nearby, we're actually still recording remotely. So thank you, Josh, for being here.

**Josh Navey:** Yeah, it was great to be with you, man.

**Tim Hopper:** Summit is a well-known church in the area, and I had seen some content they had published about thinking about safety for children in churches. And I was able to get in touch with Josh, who is your role is specifically kids pastor. Is that right?

**Josh Navey:** That's right. Yeah. So my role starts at birth and goes through fourth grade. And so we work with those kids and families in that elementary and down age group.

**Tim Hopper:** So Josh, I wanted to talk to you today about how churches can work to keep kids safe and deal with challenges that come up around safety. And this takes all kinds of different forms in churches, but on a high level, why is it important for us to think about this at churches?

**Josh Navey:** That's a very important one, Tim. And I would start by saying that child abuse is the number one reason that churches are taken to court in our culture. So just from a practical, how are we best protecting ourselves and the gospel mission? And thinking about child safety and prevention is a huge deal for us in our culture.

One in six boys, and this is Department of Justice numbers, one in six boys and one in four girls are sexually abused in the United States before the age of 18, which is almost mind-blowing thinking about the scope and the scale of that.

But it is something very significant that we need to be proactive in fighting against. I don't know if I can think of another event That would prove more significant in derailing a gospel ministry of a church than for child abuse, child sexual abuse to be a part of the church family there. So I think safety really is the foundation on which our mission of sharing the gospel with kids and families can flourish. And so we have to work hard to build that foundation.

**Tim Hopper:** We've talked about a variety of different things on this podcast. In the big picture, we care about this because it's an outworking of our love for the children and for the families and for the people. And our love for God, ultimately, is how we honor Him in this area. We're quick to talk about the gospel in our context, at least here at the summit, and our love of the gospel and sharing the gospel. And sometimes it can even be assumed that safety has to be there for the gospel to go forward in the hearts of our kids. But if we love the gospel, then we will love the safety of the kids that are coming through our doors each and every weekend.

So I think those are things that go very much hand in hand. The reason I wanted to talk to you in particular about this is you're in a role of being able to spend a lot of time and energy and effort and thinking about this for your church as this being a part of your role as kids pastor. But many of our churches are quite small. They don't have a kid's pastor.

Many churches have kind of a children's ministry director, maybe. And having been at a church now, my church is about seven years old, and we don't have that. And I'm starting to be very sympathetic to why people do have someone employed doing that. The reality is this is a task that takes a lot of time and effort and knowledge. And it can be hard for people to step back and really think about, okay, are we doing this right? Are we doing this well?

**Josh Navey:** Yeah, that's true. Was that your way of saying, you feel sorry for me that my job is to be in the kids? No, I'm just kidding.

**Tim Hopper:** Well, I think it's such a blessing that the summit is making this a priority and is able to have someone who's...

Obviously, you're not the director of children's safety, right? It's not your whole job, but it's part of your job thinking through this. And I think that's just a great thing. And as I'd asked you, I think there's a lot that smaller churches can learn from someone like you when they can't have someone like you in a full-time role or even maybe a part-time role.

**Josh Navey:** Yeah, you're very right that it can be kind of the, you see it kind of the infrastructure of what happens on a Sunday morning. And I know that is easily taken for granted. And we have people that we entrust these roles to. And so for us to be able to share some of this information, get it in their hands, I think is very important in helping kind of raise the temperature of child safety in all of our churches. Just getting at the very basic, say a new church plant is starting or another site of a church, something like that. It's a small group, maybe 100 people, 80 people. They want to have a nursery available. Maybe they want to have some Sunday school classes.

Where do we get started in even thinking about this? What are some of the key steps and kind of training essentials that really shouldn't be overlooked?

**Josh Navey:** The internet is our friend in this case. to have a child safety policy in place, even if you're a small church, I think can be really helpful in setting the tone because as you grow, it will be a foundation, a culture that you will have set at your church that it is a priority, that the people that are caring for our children have been trained and are ready to do that. So I think Even a cursory online search for a church child safety policy will yield you good results on stuff that churches would love to share and for you to take and use in your own context. Those have things like ratios for volunteers to kids, bathroom policies, diaper changing policies.

And these are all, they'll vary a little bit from policy to policy that you find. But in general, you can find something even in an easy online search that will begin for your church what that policy should look like. And then the next step would, of course, be then helping train and put it in front of your people that are going to be working with your kids, that are going to be with your kids while the service is happening, whether that's Sunday school or worship or small groups, whatever it is. But kind of in thinking about how would I initially lead out in that, a couple of things that come to mind are background checks, which is something that...

We do here for every person that serves in our kids' ministry. Anybody that is 18 years or older receives a background check. Stuff like never being alone with kids, so always having two people in a room with kids so that one adult always has eyes on the other. I mean, these are things that are for the love of the kids and their safety, but also for the love of the leaders and their protection in case things are said that we have another adult that can verify what's happening. So those are the type of things that I think are helpful in starting it out. One framework for thinking about these things is that there are kind of two types of abuse that might happen. And one is something like someone tries to come in and snatch a kid, like a kidnapper or something that's very kind of forceful or something like that. But then the other thing that churches really have to think about and maybe sometimes don't want to think about is that you do have to be conscientious about your own people caring for your kids. We know people and we pray that things won't happen, but the reality is, and statistics and case studies show that people can come in and put on a very good face and they have an evil mission of just trying to get in and get people to be comfortable with them and seem friendly. And, uh, maybe a background check, for example, could uncover, uh.

**Tim Hopper:** Uh, something like that.

**Josh Navey:** That's exactly right. I, we'd all like to think that no one in here is capable of this type of behavior. Um, I know as in the kind of churches that I grew up in, um, there, it was an older, um, population that was with our kids and oftentimes they took on grandma type roles. And so some of us, that's the first thing that comes to mind when we think kids ministry is we think, um, older ladies, maybe with, uh, with their felt boards, you know, uh, And the reality is that it's much more diverse than that and the people that are in our kids' ministry. And we have to be ready to, each person that comes in, be able to run basic things like background checks so that we can protect our kids, so that we can tell our parents that we are taking these steps and they can be assured that these are people that we know their background and what might have happened in the past. Um, so it's good for our kids. It's good for our parents. And then, um, it's good for the gospel, as we've said, um, to be able to, uh, know the background of the people that are with our most prized positions.

**Tim Hopper:** Do you have a particular, uh, recommendation on background checks that can be kind of a difficult thing for people to start thinking about? Do you, do you use a service or anything in particular?

**Josh Navey:** Yeah. Um, I'm not, I don't, I don't get, uh, paid any advertising fees. Um, but we do use AccuFacts, uh, in our context for running background checks. I know they do a good job, run a comprehensive background check.

I know there are also other companies that will do a bigger picture screening, this kind of more inclusive, all-inclusive package kind of deal with background checks. Those are more expensive, so kind of depending on your context and finances. But the AccuFax that we use is just a straight background check, and it's still expensive. I mean, it's a cost that on the whole, it'd be nice not to have that cost, but we definitely value that. That is worth it for us.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, absolutely.

I can't give any legal advice or anything, but my understanding is that there are sort of legal rules around how you even store background check information and those kind of things. So it's worth going out and doing some research on making sure you're doing that right.

**Josh Navey:** Yeah, and those companies are very helpful too. So if you were to reach out to an AccuFax or another company that's kind of like that, they have people that are more than happy to help walk you through some of those little details that are helpful.

**Tim Hopper:** Excellent. I'll link to them. And I've heard of a couple others in the show notes at waiting-tables.com. At our church, we have a two adult rule in our nursery. We just have a single nursery. And the goal, the protocol there is that there should always be.

Two adults with the children at any time. Is that something that you try to do?

**Josh Navey:** Very much. So we say that an adult can never be alone with kids. And so no matter if we have one kid or we have four, there's still going to be two adults that are back there. And then not only do we never have an adult alone, but we never want those adults to be alone with a kid, even in the context of like, say, taking a kid to the bathroom.

So there are some very specific ways that we try to hold the standard of integrity and above reproach high, even as we have multiple adults in our nursery room or whatever the case may be.

**Tim Hopper:** One of the things that we had to do as a result of that was start using a nursery pager system because early on in our church, we had one of the nursery workers might have to come into the service and get a parent for something. And we realized that if they're doing that, then they're leaving the other nursery worker alone.

**Josh Navey:** Right. Yeah. There's so many logistic thoughts that go into this. And so you could almost think of it in how we've never said this, but we almost have a three adult role, which is you have the two in the room and then the one that functions kind of as the leader that is helping if they need anything outside of the room or being able to go and talk to parents too. So yeah, that's a great thought.

**Tim Hopper:** One day we'll have the very difficult waiting tables episode on how do you actually coordinate and schedule volunteers?

**Josh Navey:** Yeah, don't invite me back. I'm sure you're familiar with that problem.

**Tim Hopper:** I really like your idea of going out and looking online at policies that people have. And that's a great option with the internet today. And that's something I would really like with the Waiting Tables website at some point to be able to have just kind of a document library, kind of what are other churches doing on this? But there is a whole lot available. And another aspect of that is when you buy insurance for a church, the insurance company may change the insurance prices even based on these kinds of policies. If you have a good policy in place, they'll evaluate that and you potentially have cheaper insurance. That's not the first reason to do this to save money, but that is a valuable thing. Do you have a regular process for reviewing your protocols and policies, both as a as a leadership team at your church and then going over with your volunteers, like do, do volunteers have to go through training again? Training is always one of the biggest questions in any ministry. That is, is a consistent thing like kids ministry, which happens every week over the course of a year. So I know there are a lot of different ways people can do it. I'll just share. This is some of the ways that we've tried to attack it. One of, one of the best ways that we've seen to hold standards high.

Across time is actually the infusion of new leaders into the ministry because every new leader is coming in and we make them go through our training and our policies and procedures. And then we give, I mean, we basically just give them permission to call people out when they come in. We encourage them that if you see something that's not working the way that we're explaining right here at any point, then we want you to feel the ability, whether they've been here for five years or 50 years to say, hey, at our training, this is the way that we were taught to do this. Because often it's the people that have been around the longest that kind of feel like the policy might not matter as much to them. Not because they don't love the kids. In fact, they love the kids maybe more than anybody. It can feel tedious sometimes when you're like, I've been around these kids every week. It's fine if I just take this one kid to the bathroom. Those are the types of times that our new leaders actually can speak out the quickest and say, actually, this is the way that we did it. So I would say that's one of the best ways is training every new leader on their way in and then holding the standard high, encouraging them, giving them that ability. We also do have regular trainings for all of our leaders. Right now, we do this once a year and we're going to be able to do it. Try to make it a big deal. We have policies, kind of the boring part, if you will, as a part of it, but we also try to encourage them.

Set the vision of being the partner with parents and the discipleship that we want to provide that supports what mom and dad are already doing at home. So all of that kind of fits into that once a year training that goes for all of our leaders. And that is most assuredly a way that we hold the standard high and refresh everyone on our policies and procedures. One other thing I'll throw in real quick is we do work to update our background checks every three to five years or so. That's kind of the industry standard, if you will, right now. Because just as with everything else, we want to continue to make sure that things aren't going on under the surface that we just don't know about in someone's life. And every three to five years, kind of running that background check is one of the ways besides our obvious relationship and being with them. But that's one of the ways that we continue to maintain safety over time.

**Tim Hopper:** I think that one of the overarching messages here is that this is not something that... Child safety is not something you just do once and you check off the box and then you say, okay, our church is child safe, right?

This is probably... I mean, this is just going to go on for the life of the congregation. You just have to continue to...

**Josh Navey:** That's right. And I understand fully that 50 years ago that this probably wasn't a conversation that was happening at all and that it might even seem outlandish to some that this is a culture that we have to maintain and pursue and be proactive in, in a small congregation where everyone knows each other. Um, and yet I look right back to those numbers of one in four and one in six. And, and I think, man, this is something that the church just, we have to be good at and have to be aggressive in, um, because we, we love our kids and we want them to be taken care of and treasured in the way they're supposed to be. Um, so I agree with you. It's, it's not just a one time. It's not like a, um, a set it and forget it. It's a culture that we have to continually be, um, preaching to ourselves and to our leaders.

**Tim Hopper:** How can building design and just layout and those kind of things play into child safety? I'll give you an example.

When we moved into our church building a few years ago, it had some rooms that didn't have any visibility into the room. And one of our pastors who is a wise pastor, he's been in the ministry now for 50 years. When we moved in, he said, first thing we need to do is get windows put into those doors because people need to be able to see into those rooms. Are there other things that we can think about?

**Josh Navey:** If someone can't see what's happening in a room, then that's obviously less than optimal. So windows are a great idea. The half doors are another great idea. If you don't want to just have a whole bunch of windows, instead of having a full door shut, you can close the half bottom door and keep the top one open.

On a little bit more of a big scale, I know a lot of our smaller churches, they might either meet in a very traditional building that kind of has the educational wing, or if they're a church plant, then it's in a very untraditional, non-traditional format, in anything from a movie theater to a community center. One of the big things, kind of thinking big picture, is being able to, control the traffic flow in and out of a kid's space.

So if our job is to protect our kids, I think that starts with knowing who's with them, who can be in there.

And it can be very difficult sometimes when there might be seven or eight entrances into the kids area for us to really know who's coming in and who's going. So that would be just one idea I thought there is How could you maybe limit the entrances so that maybe everyone comes in one or two doors? And then that's when we can help have a security or a check-in or a host kind of team be ready for people and be able to keep an eye on who's coming in and out so that we can identify that in our kids' areas.

**Tim Hopper:** If you're building a church building today, it's just you should take some time to think about this. Or if you're retrofitting a building, when you have that ability to make good decisions about this, try and think about the security and safety factor as you're doing that. I mentioned we got these windows put in our doors and you mentioned Dutch doors or these half doors. We have our church building is just an interesting hodgepodge of construction and it has irregular sized doors. And so we couldn't just go buy a standard Dutch door. But we hired a carpenter who literally came in and sold our door in half. And that's one way to do it.

**Josh Navey:** Yeah. I mean, he actually had to he like cut the hinge in half. It was a steel doorframe. And yeah. And but it worked great. And my point there being like.

**Tim Hopper:** So there might be more you can do than you think about.

**Josh Navey:** Yeah, yeah, that's commitment to child safety right there. Sawing doors in half, I like it.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, well, it keeps, among other things, those Dutch doors keep the little ones from all running out in mass when you open the door.

**Josh Navey:** Yeah, that's right.

**Tim Hopper:** What role can parents play here in helping and helping keep their own children safe and helping with other children? I mean, this shouldn't all be falling on the shoulders of the church employees and volunteers.

**Josh Navey:** I love the kind of Think Orange model of that. It's the church and the home working together to disciple the kids and seeing the parents as the primary disciples. And so kind of bringing that into the child safety realm. I love that too. So in just a couple... Thoughts that come to mind when you say parents helping out with child safety.

One is remember your pickup tag. So if any dads or moms, you know the thought that you've lost your tag and you can't pick up your kid. But just be diligent about having that. And for churches that maybe don't have a check-in, check-out, I think that's a crucial part of safety is having a system, Even if it's only five to seven kids, that you have a sticker that goes on them that has things like name, emergency contact number, allergies, and then another tag that the parents would keep and that you can match up at the end of the service and know that this is the right parent getting the right kid. It also gives you a way to be able to contact parents during service. I know there are a lot of other ways that you could do check in, check out. But as one example, I think having a secure way that the kids are dropped off and then picked up is a huge part of safety. And I know that in a lot of locations that parents are looking for that now.

I would feel unsafe if I didn't have a secure way that I was dropping and picking up kids. So I think check-in is a big part of how parents can help and being diligent about the pickup tags. I'll give you two more that are a little outside of the box and might be tools for the kids volunteer that's listening to this right now because their senior pastor just passed off the podcast to them. One way a parent can help is to serve in the kids' ministry and to just be aware of how much the church loves and cares for the kids that are a part of their church family. So one way a parent can serve the church and help keep their kids safe is to be a part of the kids' ministry. And then the other way I would say is just helping teach our kids about their bodies. So I know I'm leaning a little more towards the –.

The hidden abuses, not necessarily like the intruder with a gun coming in, but the one that kind of comes from the inside that you didn't see coming. But a book that I love is God Made All of Me. And that's Holcomb is who wrote that. And that's just a great introduction for parents and preschoolers and young elementary kids to talk about their body and what's appropriate and not appropriate for people to touch. and I think does it in a really healthy way and appropriate way. And so as we're teaching our kids what is appropriate and inappropriate, it also serves us in keeping them safe in public spaces and in our church spaces too.

**Tim Hopper:** You talked earlier about the volunteers who have been doing this forever and they can kind of feel like, oh, well, this policy doesn't apply to me. I think that can be a temptation for parents to...

Like, oh, you know me, I've been here a while. And I would say one of the things parents can really do is joyfully honor and respect the policies that the church is trying to put in place.

**Josh Navey:** That's very true. I see the irony when it happens that in that moment, when you're very frustrated that I'm making you show me ID or go find your tag, that I almost care more about the safety of your kids than you do. You don't realize it as a parent, but not getting super frustrated and flustered, but just knowing, I mean, this church is caring for my kid by making me have the appropriate paperwork or tag to get my kid back. That's really an act of love towards you and your family.

**Tim Hopper:** Do you recommend a particular system for the check-in, check-out? I know there are a number of ways that, a number of kind of electronic sources you can get these days for doing that they'll automatically print a label for you and you can have a tablet or something check in and check out do you have anything that you really like or um

**Josh Navey:** no we um we use the city um it is uh fine for what it's designed to do but uh i think there are probably for a smaller church um something like kid check or um in that realm even if if you're a um, Even if it's a low enough number of kids that it could just be something that you have printed and ready and you just write them each Sunday. I wouldn't feel like you have to have something that's digital or that looks good with an iPad.

Just more that it's functional and that it gives you the right information that you need while looking presentable is kind of how I would look at it. So I wouldn't get too caught up in the technology, though it can serve you well as the numbers grow more. Make sure that just the function is there.

**Tim Hopper:** Important point here is with the check-in, check-out system is it being fancy is not the point. It's about the safety. And if you have a low-tech solution that requires less technical support, that's not a bad idea.

We actually have numbered pagers that we hand out. we use physical pagers and then it corresponds to a number of the child on just a paper sign-in sheet and the parents are supposed to return the numbered pager to get the child back. I think those are all accomplishing the same, the same vision, just figuring out what works best in your context. What about outside of, uh, concern about abuse and those kinds of things? Do you have a thought on more kind of emergency situations like natural disasters or unfortunately even thinking about shooters? Uh, the, do you, do you work on that, those kinds of issues?

**Josh Navey:** Yeah. So I might not be able to give very helpful information, but I do know that we have an exit plan for anything like that posted in every room, almost like you would think of at a school building. If a shooter comes, this is the lockdown. If there's a natural disaster type thing, this is the quickest way out. Fire alarm, this is the quickest way out. Those are documents that are a little above my pay grade in creating.

But I know that with a drawing, it's something that anybody could put together. This is the plan for a teacher to know. And then that's always just posted and available. Our leaders know where they are, but that's not something that is used on a regular basis. But just being ready for that type of event, I do think is important to have available for our leaders, our rooms.

**Tim Hopper:** One of the things that we've thought about there is that if something happens, it's going to be the very natural and probably right reaction of the parents to all rush to our little nursery. And it's down kind of a narrow hallway and there's one doorway in. And the reality is if something's happening, that's going to cause a lot of chaos. And we actually ask our parents to, you know, it's hard to know if they'd be able to do it, but don't go to the nursery. Our deacons are going to head straight to the nursery and help get the kids to our... Um kind of uh pre-arranged area to meet their parents outside of a building um you know if there's a fire for example a big challenge with those kind of things is the education like it's great to have the policy but if nobody knows what it is when it comes to it it's kind of useless and a small thing i've done i don't know if it's working or not is uh we our nursery pager system um had it's like a, The same that they use in restaurants where restaurants can put little ads in them. And I actually kind of typed out our policies on some of these things.

And I put them in the plastic insert of the pager system.

**Josh Navey:** Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's a creative idea. I like that.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah. I don't know if anyone ever rereads them.

When the sermon gets too boring, they start. No, no senior pastor at this point, right? We're good. My pastor told me the other day he has not yet listened to this podcast. So I'm safe.

Are there good resources where churches can go to learn more? Do you, are the books or organizations that can provide help here?

**Josh Navey:** Yeah. So one organization that I really value their contributions, there are multiple. And again, a search will be able to pull something up on Google quickly. But Darkness to Light is an organization that helps provide a lot of training for emergency situations and for abuse prevention. So I have been to one of their trainings in person, but they also have a lot of online resources as well. And like I said, on the background check stuff, some of these providers are helpful as you just reach out and ask. They want to help make this as easy as possible for churches setting it up. And you mentioned as well, the insurance providers. A lot of times if you have a question, they're more than happy because it's in their best interest too. So they're more than happy to help and point you to the right people or help you find the right solutions as you're thinking about something like an emergency exit plan or abuse prevention training, those types of things. They're a great resource for us as well.

**Tim Hopper:** A book that I found really helpful is On Guard by Deepak Raju from Capitol Hill Baptist in Washington, D.C. I'm hoping to interview him at some point. He's on sabbatical at the moment. He told me he didn't want to do it on sabbatical, but I think he has a background in psychology.

Uh, or psychiatry, maybe even, and, but he's a pastor there and he's written a book on these very issues that has been really helpful for us. It talks about, uh, background checks, um, having a child protection policy, what to do about reporting abuse, how to respond to, uh, allegations of abuse. Um, he has some appendices. He has like some training material, uh, Um, he has some recommendations on background check agencies. It's a really helpful handbook for people who are just starting to think about this. I would recommend it.

**Josh Navey:** You, you even mentioned, um, one of the, one of the guys on our staff, Brad Hambrick, um, he has a great resource on what it looks like to have a plan for follow-up in case there is an, an abuse that happens inside your church ministry. Um, so, uh, that would be another one that I would, I would say, um, just in, in helping establish some of those introductory.

This is what it might look like if we haven't thought about this before. But yeah, that's a great resource to recommend as well.

**Tim Hopper:** So Brad just published an article in Table Talk magazine about that. And then I saw he has a lot of resources on his personal website on how do churches respond to events after the fact? If things have happened, how do you respond and deal with those? Which, unfortunately, we may need it at some point. And it's worth knowing that there are resources out there and people have thought through these things.

**Josh Navey:** Yeah, that's right.

**Tim Hopper:** Josh, this has been really helpful for me. Is there anything else that you'd like to add that we've overlooked or not thought about?

**Josh Navey:** If there are any pastors that have made it to the end, I just want to encourage you guys to, because this will be a champion for the people that are working with your kids. They have such a heart to see the gospel go forward in the next generation that they're putting this time and effort and energy into this. And so I want to encourage you guys as you're serving with kids and families at your church to not give up in the good works that you're doing, but to persevere and continue and know that this is a work that has generations worth of fruit to come.

And then also just to encourage pastors to continue to be champions and encouragers for the people that are working with the next generation, especially in this issue of safety, but also in discipleship and all the ways that they're trying to advance the work of the gospel and the families of your church.

**Tim Hopper:** Absolutely, that's great. Thank you so much, Josh.

**Josh Navey:** All right, Tim, thank you.

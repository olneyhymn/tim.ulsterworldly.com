Since 2013, I have served as a deacon [Shiloh Presbyterian Church](https://shilohopc.org), a congregation of the [Orthodox Presbyterian Church](https://opc.org) in Raleigh, NC. Since 2016, I’ve served as a member and chairman of the OPC Presbytery of the Southeast Commitee on Diaconal Ministries. Since 2021, I have served on the OPC [Committee on Diaconal Ministries](https://opccdm.org), and since 2023 I’ve chair the Diaconal Training Subcommittee. 

I have been married to Maggie since 2015 and we have four children.

By day, I'm a computer programmer. You can learn more about that side on my [professional website](https://tdhopper.com).

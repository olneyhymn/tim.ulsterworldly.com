> As you become an adult, you realize that things around you weren't just always there; people made them happen. But only recently have I started to internalize how much tenacity *everything* requires. That hotel, that park, that railway. The world is a museum of passion projects.

This general insight applies so strongly in church work. 

I serve as a deacon at my [local church](https://www.shilohopc.org), chairman of our [presbytery](https://pseopc.org) diaconal committee, and as a member of the [OPC Committee on Diaconal Ministries](https://www.opccdm.org). At every level, nothing was always there; every publication, every conference, every building renovation, every conversation came from someone who made it happen. 

We all stand on the shoulders of giants. What will we build for those in the future?

*The plans of the diligent lead surely to plenty...* (Proverbs 21:5)

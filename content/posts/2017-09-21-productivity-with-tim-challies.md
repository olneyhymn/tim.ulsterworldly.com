*Waiting Tables Episode 9 with Tim Challies*

{{< audio src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/waitingtables-media.com/audio/ep-09-with-tim-challies.mp3" >}}

I speak with [Tim Challies](http://www.challies.com), author and pastor, about his book [Do More Better](http://amzn.to/2x8Gd9j). Tim helpful frames productivity in a Christian worldview, and his little book is very helpful for church leaders who have to juggle a breadth of responsibilities and priorities.

### Why Productivity

Tim Challies defines productivity as

> Productivity is effectively stewarding your gifts, talents, time, energy, and enthusiasm for the good of others and the glory of God.

As Christians, we should strive to be good stewards of our time and energy out of our love of God and love for others. A systematic approach to productivity is not an end to itself, but a outworking of the greatest commandment.

> An understanding of productivity needs to begin with an understanding of the reason you exist. Productivity is not what will bring purpose to your life, but what will enable you to excel in living out your existing purpose.
>
> --- Tim Challies in *Do More Better*

### Productivity and Personal Mission Statements

I talk with Tim about how he has found it helpful to write mission statements for the various areas of responsibility in his life: church, family, work, etc. These mission statements help him prioritize his time and focus on doing the right things. He's written a brief ["productivity worksheet"](https://s3.amazonaws.com/domorebetter/Productivity+Worksheet.pdf) that you can use to help organize your responsibilities and missions.

> Your primary pursuit in productivity is not doing more things, but doing more good. Generally speaking, you can do more good for others if you have fewer roles and projects than if you have more.
>
> --- Tim Challies in *Do More Better*


### Tools for a productive life

In _Do More Better_, Tim talks about the three essential tools for his productivity workflow:

* Task management tool. A task management tool enables you to capture and organize your projects and tasks.
* Scheduling tool. A scheduling tool enables you to organize your time and notifies you of pending events and appointments.
* Information tool. An information tool enables you to collect, archive, and access information.

We discuss the value of those tools and why it's worth paying money for good tools.

### Managing Email

In 2017, nearly everyone is using email in all parts of their life. Many (if not most) churches use email for decision making among leadership leaders, for coordination of volunteers, for updating the congregation.

Tim's book has a helpful appendix on taming your email. In this episode, we have a brief discussion of email. We review Tim's 4 step workflow for handling new emails, and we talk about why email makes a bad todo list.

### Consistency is Key

All of this will only be valuable if you apply it consistently. After listening to the interview, take some time to read carefully through [Do More Better](http://amzn.to/2x8Gd9j).

## Transcript

**Tim Hopper:** Special guest, Mr. Tim Challies. You may well know Tim from his popular blog at Challies.com, where he has now blogged for over 5,000 consecutive days. I remember Tim blogging about as long as I've been reading Christian blogs. He has also written several books, including The Next Story, Visual Theology, and The Discipline of Spiritual Discernment. Today, I asked him to come on and talk with me about his excellent little book called Do More Better, A Practical Guide to Productivity. Hello, Tim. Hello. Thank you so much for coming on. It's a pleasure.

**Tim Challies:** Thank you.

**Tim Hopper:** To start off, can you tell me a little bit about where this book came from, what motivated it, and why you put it together?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah, it really came out of necessity, I think, at least in my own life. So the book came out, was actually published a little while ago, but it was many years in the making in that I got in over my head a little bit in life with family and church and work and hobbies and everything else that was going on in life, and there was just plain too much going on. And I realized that I needed to work on my productivity. I needed to get better at that. So like most people, I turned to some of the books and I just got more and more frustrated. I found that very little worked and eventually realized that I was missing really a key component that very few of the books out there will actually address.

And so once I found that, well, then I was in much better shape. And from there, I was able to build a productivity system on top of it and do more better than simply reflects what I learned along the way and what I implemented in my own life. And so my idea was, if I can just tell people how I do this, then hopefully people can pick up on it. They can take what they want, ditch the rest. But if they grow in productivity properly defined through it, then I'm happy.

**Tim Hopper:** I think a lot about productivity and these similar kind of things. And I was similarly motivated by kind of feeling overwhelmed a few years back. And maybe you never really think about productivity until you have to. I guess there has to be some kind of breaking point for that. But I particularly wanted to talk to you about it in the context of churches. In my own experience, this is something that can just help a lot in churches and thinking about productivity and thinking about how we keep things organized. And do you apply this in your own role in your church?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah, absolutely. I apply it to all of my life. And then my role in the church as an elder in the church is one of my responsibilities. So absolutely, I apply it and have actually gone into the church and talked to the staff members there about it and tried to help them implement some of its principles and so on.

**Tim Hopper:** In my own life, about four and a half years ago, I became a deacon. And this is when I really started to think, okay, I need a way to be organized was I'd show up to church and people would just ask me about various things. And I'd say, okay, I need to get back to you on that. And then the next week, someone would say, okay, you didn't get back to me. I was like, oh man, I need some way to actually manage this.

So now I tell people, if you ask me something at church and I don't pull out my phone and write it down in my notes app, then I'm not actually going to get back to you. So make sure I do that.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah. So one thing I really liked about your book versus some others is you really like to kind of frame productivity in a Christian context. So you think about productivity in the context of loving your neighbor and seeking the glory of God. Can you tell me a little bit about how you frame that?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah. So earlier I said I was missing a key piece in my attempts to be more productive. And that's largely because I was reading books that were written by unbelievers. And so of course I was missing that key piece. And the key piece was simply that, that the idea behind productivity It's not just to make myself happy, make myself feel fulfilled. Make myself wealthier, all of those things. That's all meaningless. What matters is that I'm serving others and through serving others, I'm bringing glory to God. So once I laid that foundation, well, that changed everything. Now I had the big purpose behind productivity. That was what really compelled me then to say, okay, now this matters so much. I'm not looking for a quick fix here. I'm stripping right down to the foundation and I'm going to build something new on top of it.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah. So for example, a very well-known book is the Getting Things Done by David Allen is kind of one of the preeminent books in this space. And he certainly doesn't have that kind of a context of thinking about productivity.

**Tim Challies:** As you say in your book, productivity is effectively stewarding your gifts, talents, time, energy, and enthusiasm for the good of others and the glory of God. I'm very dependent upon getting things done in the sense that he was the one who really framed this way of looking at life through areas of responsibility and through the different projects and tasks that you do. So a lot of my breakdown is dependent upon him. The funny thing is, it's not drawn from his book. It's drawn from people who created apps that reflect his book. And so there's this whole genre of apps called getting things done apps. And it was really through using those apps. That's what helps solidify in my mind the different categories. So once I had set my mind on, I'm going to do good to others to glorify God, well, then it was through using these apps that I was able to frame that idea of, I need to divide my life into areas of responsibility. And in each area of responsibility, I need to come up with projects. And so all that was sort of unwittingly based on Alan. It wasn't until later that I read his book and realized that, oh, I was drawing from him, even before I read the book. I actually will confess I've never actually finished reading, getting things done. But I've really learned a lot through that people who have been influenced by him.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah. And, you know, his big idea is mind like water, right? So he's kind of going, I mean, that's an anti-Christian idea. It's drawn from...

**Tim Challies:** Buddhism or something, it's drawn from a whole different faith tradition, this idea that your mind should be clear. And you know, we know what he's saying. He's not being fully religious with it, but there's something far better than having a mind like water. There's something far more noble, which is doing the will of God, right? Knowing what it is that God has called you to do and then doing that with the best of your time, energy, enthusiasm, and so on. So that's where I think Christians really need to bear down and where Christians can really find this deeper fulfillment in being productive.

**Tim Hopper:** Yes, absolutely. So one of the takeaways in your book is that the idea of productivity and thinking about productivity doesn't immediately just mean that you need to be productive in some sense or doing things all the time or just saying yes to everything. So I think in particularly in the, this is helpful in thinking about church leaders is that when we think about productivity, that should also enable us to say no more often or to be willing to say no. Do you think it's important for church leaders to say no to things?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah, absolutely. Productivity is heavily, proper productivity is heavily dependent upon a willingness and an ability to say no. So in order to be properly productive, you have to know what it is that God has called you to. You have to know what it is that you are especially responsible for. And then you have to bear down on those few things. There's so many things you could do at any given moment. And I think so few that are really crucial, that are really important. And so the ability and willingness to say no becomes an absolutely crucial part of being productive.

**Tim Hopper:** There's various reasons we can say yes to way too many things. It may be that We just have this fear of man, right? In a church, I think, especially with church leaders, you want people to be happy. You want people to honor you.

And it can feel in your mind that the way to do that is to say yes to whatever people ask me to. You want me to go and do this for you? I'll be there. You call me up, I'm heading right over to your house. All of these things. But, you know, if you're visiting someone and not preparing a sermon and yet you're the guy who's called to preach, then maybe you just need to think, okay, is there someone else who could do that? Could I have said no to that? Could I have rearranged that meeting? Are there ways I can say no to things that are still gracious, still helpful to people, but I'm focusing in on what I believe God has called me specially to do. I think that's a very important ability to say no to those things that are just going to distract from the main thing. And I think one of the advantages of thinking about what you actually have on your plate, what your responsibilities are, what you need to be done, is it helps you to actually answer that question. Okay, someone says, can you do this? You can actually think about, do I really have time in my week, in my day, or am I able to make time to do this?

Versus if you're not really keeping track, it can be easy to just keep saying, oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. And it keeps piling on.

**Tim Challies:** Yeah. And a lot of the way we respond to those things, I believe, is just the way we frame it in our own minds and then the way we tell it to others. There's a difference between saying, I'm sorry, I'm too busy versus saying, I'm sorry, but I just can't make that a priority right now. One is a way of saying, I've taken on too much in life. The other is a way of saying both to the other person and to yourself, I know what I'm about, and I'm sorry, I can't prioritize that ahead of other things right now. I think that's far more noble and far more helpful both to you and to that other person.

**Tim Hopper:** I actually try to intentionally use that language people of.

Oh, did you get this done? Or can you do this? And instead of saying, I didn't have time, I try to say I didn't make time, because often we can make time.

It's a question of, is that something we are wanting to do and is wise for us to do?

**Tim Challies:** Absolutely. Yeah. And I consider myself somebody who does a lot, but I don't consider myself a busy person under the normal circumstances in life. So I have a lot going on, but I'm not busy because I've tried to make sure I'm not overwhelmed. I'm not overdoing it. I've metered out the things in my life and hopefully, yeah, that should deadlines come along and sometimes there's a press, but I don't consider myself busy because in that sense, I see busy as a negative term. and the very thing I'm trying to avoid, which is busyness. And I would recommend Kevin DeYoung's book on that, Crazy Busy, was helpful for me in thinking about busyness.

**Tim Hopper:** We're going to talk a little bit about kind of software tools and ways of just organizing what you have on your plate. But another advantage of doing that and kind of writing things down and being organized is it helps you to walk away from your responsibilities when you need to, whether that's, okay, I'm going on vacation with my family. I can look and see what has to be done before I leave next week. Similarly, in your book, you talk about as Christians, we need to be prepared to deal with interruptions and recognize that things happen that don't go as planned. And we're just going to have to jump in there. And when we're organized, we're able to do that more effectively and not have everything fall apart if we need to be gone for a day.

**Tim Challies:** Right. Yeah. We have to live in a space where we are willing to be interrupted because sometimes God does bring along these divine interruptions here. Allows these things to happen.

And that's got to be okay. And perhaps especially for people in ministry, in some ways, the interruptions are your ministry.

And it's true to some degree for all of us. On the other hand, some of those interruptions are actually interruptions that really would keep you from the things that are most important. It's the thing that only you can do. So having that sense of, am I just fearful of people? Do I want people to love me? And so I'm going to say yes, even though I shouldn't. Or on the other side, am I just proud? And, you know, I guess God has brought this thing along or whatever it is that there's this opportunity. I'm just saying no to that because I'm a proud person. I'm convinced that I am in control of my own life. And so there's different ways of looking at it. Both are sin. I think we've got to prayerfully consider things, know what we're about, and then respond with a yes or no accordingly. And to do it, again, according to matters of priority, not busyness.

**Tim Hopper:** Chapter four of your book is about stating your mission. And you've gone through in your own life and thought about kind of not having maybe necessarily a global mission statement that everything falls into, but you define mission statements for different components of your life. Can you tell us how you've done that?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah, I think one of the things that intimidates people when it comes to most books on productivity is that they want you to have this life-wide mission statement. So this is who I am. This one little sentence describes my whole life. And I think for some people that's intimidating. I'm also not sure it's that helpful.

So what I try to get people to do is to look at each area of their life, to divide their life into areas of responsibilities, and then to frame a kind of mission statement for each one. So as a dad, this is my mission. Or as a husband, this is my mission. In my home, in my family, here's the mission I believe only I can fulfill.

In my church, here's my mission. Here's what I mean to accomplish in the life of this church. In my work, in hobbies, in my neighborhood, in all these areas, this is what I believe God has called me to. I think that's a helpful way of then, week by week, you can look at that statement and say, did I do that last week? Where did I succeed? Where did I fail? And how will I do that next week? What are the things I can implement? What are the things I can add to my schedule? What are the tasks I need to complete in order to do this successfully in the week ahead? I find that a helpful way of continually drawing myself back to what I'm about.

**Tim Hopper:** This kind of combines with the idea of saying no in that it gives us a framework for thinking through the things that we're going to spend time on. And obviously, you could use that selfishly as, you know, oh, someone in your church says, can you come help me move on Saturday?

Responding that doesn't fit in my personal mission. It's probably not a loving thing to do, but.

**Tim Challies:** Okay, I agree. I agree. But if you're the pastor of the church and you're running out to help somebody move on a Saturday, then two things might be going on. A, you might be taking away from something that really ought to be a higher priority. And B, you might be denying other people the opportunity to serve in that way. Because sometimes I think the best thing you can do is say, no, you know what? I don't think I can, but let me call the deacons and we'll have some people come over and other people can serve them. So that's a tricky thing, right? Evaluating each situation as it comes up. I really appreciate you drawing that point out because I think that's helpful. And as a deacon in my own church, that's actually the kind of thing we try to think about with our elders, with our pastors. How can we protect their time? Because things don't always make sense. And yeah, so that is really helpful.

**Tim Hopper:** Something that I've kind of wrestled with is I've become really organized using these kinds of things that you've talked about over the last few years. And one of the interesting challenges is that people know once they learn that you're reliable, because you're organized, they just come to you with seemingly more and more things versus going and asking somebody else. Have you dealt with that at all? Or like, do you think about how to handle that?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah, I've certainly seen that happen, where not only that, but I find that people who are very organized tend to almost have to be responsible for other people's lives. Did you remember to do this? Have you completed this?

So I think one of the dangers of being an organized person is we can very quickly take pride in it, right? We can really think we are in some way morally superior or better people. You know, we're very prone to pride to think that, I don't know that we go so far as to think that our sanctification, our salvation depends upon this thing, but it's easy to look askance at those who who haven't implemented this kind of stuff. And I think we need to protect ourselves there. But certainly you're right that if you're organized, people begin to trust you with things. They'll come to you because they have a higher level of confidence that you will take action on it, a higher level of confidence that if they come to you, something good will come of it.

**Tim Hopper:** When I got married a few years ago, one of our pastors said to me, we talked about this specific thing and how I would sometimes feel responsible for making sure I'm kind of kind of become other people's personal management system. And he said to me, you know, you just need to let other people take responsibility for themselves. Sometimes that's, that's not always on you.

**Tim Challies:** Right. Yeah. It's often not your responsibility. And sure, there's ways of helping and serving people. But it can become something that's, that's unhelpful when you're not helping people. Probably the better thing you can often do is try and help other people along, right? Teach them some systems, teach them how perhaps they can be a a little more organized because I think there's a lot of people who are frustrated. And one of the things we're prone to do is we identify a problem like this in our lives and we respond by looking for a quick fix. We go to lifehacker.com or something and we look for five quick tips that will fix my productivity problem. That never or very rarely works, right? We've got to start at the foundation. Do you really want to live a life that's pleasing to God, right? Well, that life looks like doing good to others, which brings God glory. So how are you going to deliberately aim at that. Now you're building that foundation. That's what I think can be very helpful.

**Tim Hopper:** To people. Your book has some kind of practical steps of what systems can look like for these things. But I would encourage anyone who's wanting to think more about this, if you pick up Tim's book, which I would encourage you to do, don't skip over the kind of higher level philosophy sections of the first few sections, like really think through productivity and organization from your position as a Christian, because it does have a lot to say to us there.

**Tim Challies:** Yeah, it makes all the difference. It really does.

**Tim Hopper:** So I don't want to go into all the detail about kind of systems here, but people can pick up the book and read about it. But let's just talk a little bit about the three types of tools that you recommend people use. One is an organizer for tasks. One is a calendar for organizing actual appointments, things that take place in time. And then a third kind of tool for organizing information. Can you just give us a brief description of why you recommend those three things?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah, I think those three things together are the tools you need for a productivity system. So I'm a big advocate of using the right tool for the job, which is why I use Apple Computer.

Um, I think what we tend to do when it comes to certain areas of life, so listen, if you go to a doctor and your doctor has been shopping at the dollar store to buy his, his instruments and buy his, you know, the things he's going to use to evaluate your health or to, to heal you, you think, you know, I'd rather go to a doctor who's buying the best tool for the job, not the cheapest one. Generally, I think we as Christians can and ought to defend buying the best tool for the job. We, what we're doing in life is not just meaningless tasks. We're seeking to live for the glory of God. And I think better tools help us do that better. And when it comes to productivity, I think what we tend to do is skimp out. We want free solutions. We don't want to spend $5 or $50 on an app. We want to get some cheap thing. We want to go really cheap in it. I think there's a lot of value in finding the best tool and in using that tool. So the tools I recommend are, as you said, there's an information tool. And the job of that tool is to store and then retrieve information. In the old system, this was a filing cabinet full of files and pieces of paper.

In a more modern world, this is some sort of software program that simply stores information. When you need it again, you can retrieve it. It's a great tool. Then there's a scheduling tool or a calendar, which, again, existed in the old world in paper. Today we can get it in electronic forms. You can use either, but the electronic ones offer some great benefits. You can have multiple calendars. You can set reminders. They can even tell you traffic's bad, so you need to leave a little early. There's a lot of great benefits to it. And then the third is a task management tool. And I guess maybe in the pre-digital world, this was a day timer or something along those lines.

But today, there's great programs. You mentioned OmniFocus, which is probably the most powerful. There's many others as well. And the job of a tool like that is just to help you organize your tasks and your projects to tell you what you need to do and to make sure that when somebody hands you a responsibility or when you think of an idea, it goes into this tool. When you think of something that needs to be done or accomplished, it goes into this tool. This tool is created to help you carry out your tasks. And it's very, very good at what it does. So the idea then is to get these three tools and then to get them working together to synchronize them so that you've built a system out of using these three things.

**Tim Hopper:** And you make some specific recommendations in the book. People can find out more there.

And there are certainly countless blog posts and other resources online, people talking about these kind of specific tools. I think something that a lot of people are particularly lacking here is using some kind of dedicated task management tool that is kind of comprehensive as well as persistent. So people are often good at making kind of a one-off list for this thing or this thing. But the idea that you propose and that I've really found valuable is kind of having one system that's tracking all tasks across different parts of your life. And that's a persistent thing that you are, things are always going into the same place over time. You know, I have to admit or acknowledge that I'm in knowledge work. And so my life is different from somebody who's perhaps in a trade or something. I spend my life pretty much at a desk staring at a glowing rectangle. So that means my life is different. And something like a task management tool becomes absolutely essential in every area of my life. If you're in a different line of work you're in well i think a trade is a good example of that kind of work uh you're in the military certain you know there's certain jobs where that level of of um or that kind of tool won't be as helpful because you don't have the same sort of pool of things you can do every day and you're deciding between them your life is is more regimented in a different direction and that's that's okay but for people in knowledge work and then for people in the rest of life outside of their vocation that's where i think this task management tool is especially helpful and especially necessary.

**Tim Hopper:** I'm a computer programmer by day, and I don't particularly use OmniFocus, which is my tool of choice for my work. And keeping track of what I need to do at work isn't super complicated because I'm doing it eight hours a day. And I do relatively the same thing all day. I'm not doing a bunch of different things. But where it's really paid off for me is being able to keep track of all these other things in my life. Do I need to get my car inspected every year? Do I need to do our payroll for our church every month? Do I need to send someone a reminder in a few weeks so I can go and put that in that task? All those other kinds of things are where it's really paid off for me. I'd be willing to say even someone who's not in kind of a knowledge work type of job still has all these other things in your life. And if nothing else, if you're serving in your church, you have these responsibilities. And if you commit to do them to someone on Sunday, are you going to remember on Thursday night that you need to do it? Or are you're going to be scrambling the next Sunday morning? Like, oh, I forgot I was supposed to do that before this week. That's where it's really helped me.

**Tim Challies:** Yeah. To be clear, I think that the most important thing is not that you implement my system, but that you implement some kind of a system. Because I really think it does come down to, as Christians, we're to be people of our word. And as Christians, we're meant to be helpful to others.

And I don't know how we do that if we don't remember things. I guess maybe some people have a memory for this kind of thing. But when someone comes on Sunday and says, can you do this? Or, you know, can you help me with this, that kind of stuff. Or when you have responsibilities you need to carry out, whether that's payroll in the church or any of these things, somehow you've got to have a system to ensure you will actually do that. So whatever system you come up with and hopefully perfect over time, that's the most important thing. And so I think what you and I are discussing here is one system that can be particularly effective in this modern world. That's not the only one, but I do think it's worth looking at and reading about and then just saying, would this work for me? What elements do I need to take from it? And so on.

**Tim Hopper:** Something that people often use as their system here is their email inbox. So you hear people say, okay, I'm just going to send myself an email about that to remind myself. And then they try and keep track of these things in email. And you discourage people from that. And I would discourage people from that as well. But do you have kind of an argument against using email as a to-do list?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah. Email wasn't made for that. And so if we go back to the use the best tool for the job principle, email is not meant to be a task management system. And so if we're collecting and organizing our tasks in email, we're using an inappropriate tool. Now, for some people, again, if your needs in that way are pretty basic, then maybe it will suffice. Again, come up with a system, make sure it works. But I think for most people, we get so many emails in such quantity, such flow, they're just constantly coming in that we can very easily lose things when they're in our inbox, important things. And so you come up with all these complicated ways of trying to get certain emails to remind you of things. I think for a lot of people, their system breaks down. It becomes overbearing.

There are tools that are meant for task management and they do it very well. So training yourself to use that tool, I think means you can allow email to do what it does well, which isn't very much, but it is good at certain forms of communication. So use email for that.

Stop using it for other things.

**Tim Hopper:** I will say one of the reasons probably that people like email is in this day and age, it's easy for us to always send ourselves an email. Like it's kind of a central system that we can always get to. And one of the ideas that, I don't know if David Allen invented it, but he really promoted is this idea of having an inbox for your tasks that you need to do. And so the idea is you need a way to be able to get things quickly written down so you can remember them. And then you can come back later and think about the details of it, but just a way to get it out of your brain and into your central system quickly.

And I would say whatever system you do, that's a really helpful concept, whether it's you always have a note card that you're going to write something down on, or you have an app that allows you to do it or not to keep going back to OmniFocus, which isn't certainly isn't right for everyone. But OmniFocus has a way where you can actually email a task to your to do list, which I use all the time. If someone has an sends me an email, I need to respond to, I actually kind of forward it to myself through that. And then it's in my to do list and not in my inbox.

**Tim Challies:** Right? Yeah, I think a helpful word there is friction. We want to reduce the friction between an idea in our mind and an idea in a system somewhere or a request from someone and actually taking action on that. And if it's too difficult, then you're going to be tempted to not do it. If it's too difficult to get it into a system, too difficult to remember it, etc., you're unlikely to do it. So we've got a lot of devices and a lot of.

Of technologies now that can help us. You can, if you're using an iPhone, you can just hold down that button and tell Siri to remind you and it'll go straight into OmniFocus. And then later it's in your inbox. You can properly file it away and take action on it. But there's a lot of great ways today of very quickly getting it out of your mind and into your system, which as you said, is a key principle in a productivity system.

**Tim Hopper:** That's been kind of a life changer for me. I use an iPhone app called Drafts, which is a little text kind of collection app. It's just made to be able to write things down quickly. And like I mentioned something to me at church, Tim, can you do this this week? If it's something I'm doing, I pull out my phone, write a quick line in drafts and tap a button and it sends it to my to-do list. And then sometime, you know, Sunday night or Monday, I come in and triage. Usually I get a pretty big list of things each Sunday that I take home with me. But I never have to keep reminding myself or say to my wife, remind me, remind me, remind me. You know, I just, it's written down and I don't have to keep thinking about it. And that's been a life changer for me. So you have a little kind of appendix in the book called Tame Your Email, Six Tips for Doing More Better with Email. And certainly email is something that will ever love to complain about just the volume of email and dealing with email and responding to email.

Just yesterday, because this is the kind of person I am, I was reading a hundred-year-old Presbyterian kind of newspaper from the Southern Presbyterians about 100 years ago. And there was a little blurb in one of the issues saying, we know we all get so much mail But basically, it's our Christian duty to be charitable and respond to the mail we get. And it's overwhelming. And I remember reading another time, a biography of George Washington, that he complained during the American Revolution, he just had so much mail to respond to, that it was overwhelming him. So I think email didn't really invent this problem.

But it's certainly something that people are struggling with to this day. And email, the problem with email, if you will, is that it's so easy to send an email, There's no real upfront cost or burden to sending an email. Even a letter, a postal letter, far more people would have sent George Washington letters if there wasn't the difficulty of having to write it and address it and stamp it and send it off. So with email today, the reason we get so many is it's so easy and it's free. So we send them without thinking. You have four options of things you should do with an email when you get it. And the first is trash it. Some things we just don't need. And then archive it is one. With Gmail kind of invented archiving, which is you can save it without actually deleting it. Three is reply to it. And then the fourth is, I think, really the big thing, which is you talk about using a reply folder. What's the idea of using a reply folder?

**Tim Challies:** Yeah. So the idea is your inbox is simply that. It's an inbox. So the idea is you look at your inbox and you take action on everything in it. It's not a place to collect things. It's a place to take action on things. So it's like the inbox in your house, the mailbox in your house. You don't take things out of your mailbox and then put them back in. You take it out of your mailbox and you never think of putting it back in. You take action on each thing. You might file it, you might throw it out, but you do something with it. And your inbox, your email inbox ought to be much the same, that you're taking action on things there, not just letting them sit there.

**Tim Hopper:** To be fair, I mean, there's a lot of new apps that are coming along that have help us with this. Even Gmail's inbox option is a lot better at this than the plain Gmail is. And so we're developing in this way. People are coming up with better solutions and even these email slash task hybrid things. And I think that's all progress in the right direction. I would really love for more people to be self-critical and just reflect on how they handle their email and think through it. I think something a lot of people should probably do is press the unsubscribe button a whole lot more. A lot of us get a lot of things that we don't actually have to be getting. And do you actually need an ad every other day from your favorite store? Is that really helping you?

**Tim Challies:** Right. You signed up once to get the 10% discount on your first purchase and now you get it every two days. There's a lot of that. A good little tip is just to do a search in your inbox for the word unsubscribed.

The spam problems aren't nearly what they were once upon a day, right? We don't get spam the way we used to. Generally, the spam we get today is spam we signed up for. And so if you just do a search for the word unsubscribe, it'll pull up all these different newsletters and other things you subscribe to. Just pull

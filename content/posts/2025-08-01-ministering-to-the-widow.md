On [The Reformed Deacon](https://www.thereformeddeacon.org/) podcast, I spoke with Becky Haney about her experience of unexpectedly becoming a widow and how deacons can better care for widows. You can listen [here](https://www.thereformeddeacon.org/1849391/episodes/17525964-ministering-to-the-widow). It was a great privilege to speak with Becky about such a difficult topic, and I was encouraged by her transparency and faith; I hope you will be also.

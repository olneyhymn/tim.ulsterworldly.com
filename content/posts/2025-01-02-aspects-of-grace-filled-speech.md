The [Westminster Larger Catechism](http://opc.org/lc.html) shows us how each of the 10 Commandments guides us on how we are to “Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.”

+ 1st Commandment requires "highly esteeming" and "rejoicing in" God, "giving all praise and thanks".
+ 2nd Commandment requires "prayer and thanksgiving in the name of Christ”.
+ 3rd Commandment requires "that the name of God, his titles, attributes, ordinances, the word, sacraments, prayer, oaths, vows, lots, his works, and whatsoever else there is whereby he makes himself known, be holily and reverently used in ... word". It forbids "murmuring and quarreling at... God's decrees and providences" and "making profession of religion in hypocrisy".
+ 4th Commandment requires us "to dispose and seasonably dispatch our worldly business, that we may be the more free and fit for the [worship] of" the Lord on His day.
+ 5th Commandment requires "thanksgiving for" those in authority over us, "defense... of their persons and authority", and "and covering them in love"; it forbids "cursing, mocking" of those in authority. It requires us to "instruct, counsel, and admonish" those under us and forbids us from "counseling... them in what is evil." It requires us to "rejoice in each others' gifts and advancement" and forbids us from grieving in such.
+ 6th Commandment requires "peaceable, mild and courteous speeches" and prohibits "provoking words... [and] quarreling".
+ 7th Commandment requires "chastity in... words" and forbids "all corrupt or filthy communications".
+ 8th Commandment forbids "injustice and unfaithfulness in contracts between man and man, or in matters of trust".
+ 9th Commandment requires "preserving and promoting of truth between man and man, and the good name of our neighbor, as well as our own; appearing and standing for the truth; and from the heart, sincerely, freely, clearly, and fully, speaking the truth, and only the truth, in matters of judgment and justice, and in all other things whatsoever; a charitable esteem of our neighbors; loving, desiring, and rejoicing in their good name; sorrowing for and covering of their infirmities; freely acknowledging of their gifts and graces, defending their innocency; a ready receiving of a good report, and unwillingness to admit of an evil report, concerning them; discouraging talebearers, flatterers, and slanderers; love and care of our own good name, and defending it when need requireth; keeping of lawful promises; studying and practicing of whatsoever things are true, honest, lovely, and of good report." It forbids "speaking untruth, lying, slandering, backbiting, detracting, talebearing, whispering, scoffing, reviling, rash, harsh, and partial censuring".
+ 10th Commandment forbids "envying and grieving at the good of our neighbor".

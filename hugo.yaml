    title: Writings and Audio from Tim Hopper
    Content: |
      I'm dedicated to serving Christ, committed as a husband,
      father, and deacon within the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. Here, you'll find a
      collection of my theological writings and links to podcasts where I've shared my
      insights. While primarily organized for my own reference, I aim for these
      resources to be beneficial to others too.

      **What you'll find here:**
      Much of this site is [podcast](/tags/podcast/) content, including
      episodes of the [OPC CDM Podcast](/tags/opc-cdm-podcast/) on diaconal ministry
      and the [Waiting Tables](/tags/waiting-tables/) podcast on church operations.
      You'll also find my [writings](/tags/writing/) and [lectures](/tags/lecture/)
      on the [diaconate](/tags/diaconate/), as well as
      [Sunday school classes](/tags/sunday-school-class/) I've taught on topics like
      [church history](/tags/church-history/) and [the Bible](/tags/bible/).
      A few [homilies](/tags/homily/) round out the collection.
      Browse all topics on the [tags page](/tags/).

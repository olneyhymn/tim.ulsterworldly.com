I talk with pastor and designer [Josh Byers](http://www.joshbyers.com) about his recent blog post [Church Video on a Budget of $1000](http://www.joshbyers.com/blog/2017/8/church-video-on-a-budget). Josh explains how to use a DSLR camera, a microphone, and basic lighting for recording "basic interviews, testimonies, life stories and other video productions your church may have."

Here's a video from Josh's team:

A few years ago, it would've required a huge budget and a professional team to produce a video like that. Josh talks about how you can get the basic equipment for just over $1000.


### Three Point Lighting

[Three point lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_lighting) is a standard technique for illuminating a subject in video or photos. This technique is one of the best things you can do to give video a professional look.

Here's a tutorial explaining three point lighting:

## Transcript

**Tim Hopper:** With a very special guest, Mr. Josh Byers. Josh is a pastor at Willow Creek Baptist Church in West Des Moines, Iowa, and he's also the co-author and designer of the book Visual Theology, which he wrote with Tim Challies. I would love for him to tell us a little bit more about that later. I came across Josh online because he wrote a blog post called Church Video on a Budget of $1,000, which is right in the wheelhouse of waiting tables. And so I asked him if he'd come on and talk to us about that blog post a little bit. Welcome, Josh.

**Josh Byers:** Thanks, Tim. Glad to be here.

**Tim Hopper:** You're the second guest from Iowa in only a very small number of episodes on the Waiting Tables podcast. I don't know what that means. I've never been to Iowa.

**Josh Byers:** There's not a lot to do out here. So we get on the computer and get on podcasts.

**Tim Hopper:** Gotcha. And run through cornfields, I would imagine.

**Josh Byers:** Exactly.

**Tim Hopper:** Tell us a little bit about visual theology. I remember seeing that when that came out on Tim Challey's website. How'd that happen? And what was your role in that?

**Josh Byers:** So Visual Theology was a collaboration between Tim and myself. And before it became a book, we had been designing infographics for several years. I had noticed Tim had put up one on his website a number of years ago, and I had been doing these for a while. So I reached out to Tim, sent him an email, and said, hey, I've got some of this stuff if you're interested in it. And he was. And we started collaborating on future ones. The first one we actually collaborated on was the Books of the Bible Periodic Table Graphic. So we did that together and then went really well. And we seemed to work really well together. So we kept on doing more and more. And one day I emailed him and said, hey, I'm thinking about doing a coffee table book of all these graphics. And he said, I actually was thinking about doing the same thing. And so that idea kind of morphed into more of a traditional book. And so we collaborated on Visual Theology, the book, and it was published last year. And it's done really well. We're really excited about it. It ended up being more of a book about Christian living, but we're able to present that in the form of infographics and I think some really helpful things along the way.

**Tim Hopper:** That's really cool. I've not yet seen a copy. I need to order a copy.

**Tim Hopper:** I've already overspent my book budget for the month, so I might have to wait a few days. So tell me a little bit about this blog post, Church Video on a Budget of $1,000. Where did that come from? Why did you write that a few weeks ago?

**Josh Byers:** Well, it was interesting. I got an email from a person that's here in Iowa, and they had some questions about doing video, and they knew that our church does a lot of video production, and so we had a relationship with them. And so they just emailed to ask me what they would recommend. They're just getting started today. And it's something I was thinking about. And so basically the answer to that email became this blog post because they had a budget of about $1,000. And so I put together a list of items for them that they could go ahead and look at and then decided to go ahead and write that up as a post. And I added in a number of other things as well, including some different add-ons that people might want to get or some upgrades if their budget was just a little bit larger. But really, it just came out of just trying to help other smaller churches get started.

**Tim Hopper:** And it's great. It did a really good job. And you particularly had in mind not so much like a video camera for recording a whole service, but for doing things like interviews, life stories, testimonies, those kinds of maybe shorter clips or videos compiled from.

**Josh Byers:** A series of shorter clips versus just one long recording. Yeah, there was, I think those are, those are two totally separate fields that, that you can get into. And obviously you can record your services with, you know, the equipment that I recommended in the blog post. But the thinking behind it is, is just a little bit different as well.

**Josh Byers:** So yeah, I think there's, you know, not everybody needs to be recording their services with video. I would advise if you're not doing that with audio first and you're not doing it well with audio, do that first. And then, you know, if you want to jump into the video game, you can. But yeah, this was more...

**Tim Hopper:** I completely agree. That's good advice. This, yeah, this was more for, yeah, like you said, shooting testimonies or interviews with people, trying to tell the stories of people in the community, you know, doing announcements would be a good way to do that. If you want to throw some announcement videos up every so often.

**Josh Byers:** Or doing a tour of your church or something like that. So that was more what the post was designed to focus on.

**Tim Hopper:** And you have another example of this on your website from a few years ago, a post you wrote called Church Welcome Video, where you showed a short video that you made welcoming people to your church and telling them a little bit about the church to go on the website, I think.

**Josh Byers:** I can't remember exactly where the inspiration for that. There might have been another church that had done it and we saw it and I'd seen it. But I do specifically remember noting that I think it was Google or somebody else was starting to let people search inside of buildings. And I thought, well, that'd be a great thing to do. You know, if we could give people a map or a way to, you know, when they Google our church or whatever, you know, or click on the directions they can actually see inside of it. And then kind of going a step further than that, I thought, well, why don't we just let them? Let's just make a video and just show them exactly what it's like. Because if you, you know, if you visited a church before or really any new place, you know, I noticed one of the first things that I would do if I was going to someplace I'd never been before is I would hop on, you know, Google Maps and look at the street view. And so I could recognize what was around the location. So I know I was kind of in the right place.

**Josh Byers:** And that was something I thought of, okay, so why wouldn't people do that for a church as well? It goes a little bit farther because it goes actually inside the doors. But the idea was to get people familiar and comfortable with the environment and the surroundings, even before they stepped in. So it's simple things, like showing people where are the bathrooms, telling people where to go to check their kids in or to get coffee. And so as soon as you walk in our doors, if you've watched that video, you've got already an idea of where to go. You're put at ease. You're not apprehensive about going to the wrong place. Or if you don't want to talk to somebody, you don't have to ask somebody where the bathrooms are right away. You can already know those things.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, that's cool. I really like that idea. And one of the things you point out in your post is years ago, this would have been prohibitively expensive for a small church to do well. I mean, you know, we've had camcorders of various kinds, but obviously, even the medium of being able to share it over the internet has really changed things. But also the hardware and technology has completely changed and become.

**Tim Hopper:** In relative terms, incredibly inexpensive compared to years ago. And the quality you can get with quote, budget hardware is really extraordinary. And so that's really the focus of your post is is, um, not so much walking through the steps of production and, and editing and various things, but really you're, uh, focused on talking about some of the hardware that's available. Um, so we're going to walk through that and just talk a little bit about those things and hopefully, uh, let people know that there are really good resources and tools available out there. Uh, and, and you could, you could do a similar type of production to what the video that you showed of your church, um, um, with a with a limited budget so the core of it is a digital camera a dslr camera and you recommend a canon t5i which is one of the canon rebels so they're kind of budget line or uh entry level uh digital slr camera you know len i think i mentioned at the top of the post you know you could do this with a phone as well um but there's a few things that the camera gives you that the that the phone doesn't.

**Josh Byers:** So, I mean, I guess if you want to get really budget, you know, you can use your phone for all these things to start out with. But if you do have some sort of a budget, I would recommend doing this. And plus, then you're not having to worry about using your phone or if somebody wants to borrow it or if you have some other worker, they can do that as well. So, yeah, the Canon Rebel series, it's kind of on their cheaper line. And I'm a Canon guy, so that's why I recommend Canon.

**Josh Byers:** I'm assuming Nikon and Sony, they have some other budget lines as well. But the Canon brand is what I know. So that's what I recommended.

**Tim Hopper:** I'm also a Canon photographer. And a tip is you could go out and look for something like this used. You don't need...

**Josh Byers:** Brand new. And you also don't, I don't know exactly where the T5i falls in the model line, but you don't need the latest and greatest camera. And we've had cameras with 1080p HD video for several years now, and you can go buy one that's a few years older and be just fine.

**Josh Byers:** Yeah. In fact, I just went on Facebook a couple of weeks ago to their marketplace. I had a friend that was looking for a camera for their daughter. And so I jumped on Facebook to look for some of these things, and we found tons of used DSLRs. And when I say used, some of these things have been basically taken out of the box, and people maybe shot a couple pictures with it, decided it wasn't for them, and never touched it again. So yeah, there's a lot of deals out there, and the T5i is not by any means the latest model that's out there. I would say make sure that whatever camera you get, you do have a way to record audio with that. I made a mistake in the original post and I put just the Canon T5, which does not have a microphone input. The T5i actually is the one with the microphone input. So just make sure whatever brand of camera you get, you want to get one with a mic input because you don't want to be recording audio with the camera's default microphone. I think audio is probably one of the most important aspects of your recording, maybe even more so than the visuals.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah absolutely couldn't agree more and you can record audio externally on another recorder and then edit those together but that is challenging and can look really bad if you don't get it in sync it's just not worth it it's hard work.

**Tim Hopper:** Another great thing about, I would say about going with a Canon device these days is, um, there are so many lenses available and inexpensive, good and expensive lenses available. Um, and your lenses will continue to work on if you upgrade the Canon camera later on, uh, with, within some limitations, one limitation of using a DSLR that actually I think would really prohibit you from recording a sermon or a longer clip is actually that they're limited on the maximum clip length that they can record. I think this camera, the T5i will record up to 30 minutes. And my understanding, and I don't know for sure that this is correct, but that that has to do with the camera being classified as a camera versus a video recorder. And they have like different like tariffs or something.

**Josh Byers:** That's interesting. I did not know that. I mean, I guess I've never tried to record longer than that on my camera. We have recorded video testimonies for maybe an hour or so on time, but I'm always stopping the camera and then restarting it again. So I do know that the camera will break it into clips based on how long it is. So it may be that it will continuously record, but it will break it into various sized clips.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not true, but I should have researched that before saying it. But you try that before you try to record something that's longer than 30 minutes. Make sure that's going to work for you because you don't want it to cut off in the middle. And you suggest a few possible upgrade cameras. You can go up for many thousands of dollars in the Canon space. And then one other thing you suggest if you want to do an add-on is instead of using the little display on the back of the camera, you can actually buy what's called a field monitor that just is going to plug into the camera and give you a bigger display to help you with focusing and knowing what you have in your scene.

**Josh Byers:** Yeah, I can't tell you how many times I've gotten into editing the video and realized that my focus was just slightly off. And when looking at that small three-inch screen on the camera, you think you've nailed it. Then you get it into your computer and it's blown up and you realize that it was just off. And it's not a huge deal, but I like to do things as well as I possibly can. So we recently added on actually a full monitor. And actually, it's an HD computer monitor that you can see really well on. But if you just want something small, you can obviously add on that field monitor. I would say if you're at a church and you've got monitors laying around, that's something that you could really easily adapt for even cheaper than what I put on the post. You know, just throw a VGA adapter because I think most of the Canons, and again, I'm not sure about the T5i here, but they do have an HDMI out.

**Tim Hopper:** And you could plug that into one of those monitors and get a bigger picture. So this is a DSLR camera, which is a removable lens camera. You can buy just the body without a lens. And so you're going to obviously need a lens to put on it. And you recommend, and I think this is a fantastic suggestion, a lens called the Canon EF 50mm F1.8. That's a lot of words. That's only a $125 lens. That is an incredible lens. It's really great. So that's what's called a prime lens, right? Meaning you can't zoom that in and out. Well, you can. You just have to walk back and forth. Zoom with your feet.

**Josh Byers:** Yep. And the 50 millimeter lens is going to kind of be a little more zoomed in than you are just looking with your eyes. So you're going to see things a little bigger than you would see with your eyes from the same distance. But that ends up, it makes people's faces look really nice through a camera lens at that distance and that focal length. So for an interview, I think that's a really nice choice.

**Josh Byers:** Yeah, it's a real sharp lens. And then I think the nice thing about this, you know, unless you're using like a solid black background, you know, a lens with this low of an F stop will give you a real nice blurred background bokeh would be another name for that.

**Josh Byers:** You know, if you've ever looked at professional video, you know, they have the subject that's in focus. And then, you know, the background is maybe a little bit out of focus, a little bit blurry. It just adds that professional layer to what you're shooting. And this lens is, it's a game changer, really. It was the first lens I ever bought when I started photography. And literally, it took my photos to a completely new level. And it'll do the same thing for video as well.

**Tim Hopper:** I actually own the Yongnuo. It's a Chinese knockoff version of this lens. I don't know if you've ever seen that, but it's actually only $50.

**Tim Hopper:** And it's surprisingly good. Available on Amazon. I would actually recommend that. It feels like it is as cheap as can be. But my wife and I just had our first baby a few weeks ago, and I'm nailing some shots with my $50 Chinese lens of my son. So if you want to try that, but you know, the Canon one's $125. It's, it's not a huge investment. It's going to last you a long time.

**Tim Hopper:** Another option. If you want a little wider view, you recommend the Canon 24 millimeter F 2.8. I own that lens also really nice lens and also very compact. So if you want, if you need a wider view, but if you're just interviewing a single subject, I think the 50 millimeters, a really great option. Cool. So then, as you already mentioned, sound is one of the most important parts of doing this. And if you, a common thing said is if you mess up your sound on a video, it doesn't matter how sharp and good your video looks. If it's difficult for someone to listen to, they're not going to do it. So you recommend a fairly expensive device, which is the Rode, RodeLink FM wireless microphone for $435. Tell us a little bit about that.

**Josh Byers:** Yeah, it ends up being one of the more expensive things on the list, but primarily because, as you mentioned, I think audio is one of the most important aspects. If you miss your audio, like you said, it doesn't matter how good your video is because that's all people will hear, and they'll completely tune the entire video out. So, yeah, we went a little more expensive on this. I think if you're going to spend some money, this is where it should be. Rode has a really good reputation for their microphones and for their mobile microphones in particular.

**Josh Byers:** We have, in addition to this, we also have the Rode SmartLav, which is for phones. And so if you want to record audio with your phone, that's a great option as well. In fact, we actually use that as a backup when we're recording interviews and testimonies. So we have a microphone like this, like the Rode link that I put on the post. But then we also use their Rode Smart Lab and record onto a phone just as backup. So they're a great company, really good quality for the things that they put out. And I think the lapel is important when you're doing interviews, first of all, because it's out of the way of the interviewee, and it kind of puts them at ease. And it also delivers great audio no matter what direction their head is turned. Now, a good shotgun mic will pick that up. But for the budget, I think you want to stick with the lavalier mic. And I think this is a really good option for that.

**Tim Hopper:** I just did an episode recently on microphones with Todd Messer, which you can find at waiting-tables.com. And we talked about that Rode Smart Lab, which is a wired microphone that just plugs right into a phone.

**Tim Hopper:** It's very slick. And I guess it could probably plug into one of these cameras as well if you wanted, but you have the wire. So this RodeLink device is going to give you a little wireless transmitter that you put in your pocket, just like you see anyone speaking with a wireless mic. And then you're going to clip the lapel mic onto a collar or onto a tie or whatever.

**Tim Hopper:** Yeah. That's a really slick device, and I think Rode is doing some really good work in this space with these kind of microphones for the modern, affordable video and audio production world.

**Tim Hopper:** It's really nice. And then you have a couple of recommendations on there. If people are interested in upgrades, a Sennheiser wireless microphone and then a shotgun mic also from Sennheiser, which is a $1,000 microphone. But again, the idea here being that good audio really is a huge part of success with video. We use the first upgrade there, the Sennheiser EWs. Those are professional grade. And I guess for what you get, the price isn't – I don't think it's that bad. So again, if you want to spend some money, do it on the audio.

**Tim Hopper:** We've been using these Sennheisers for a couple years now and just had fantastic results. They perform flawlessly and, you know, giving us no headaches really whatsoever. And then I've got a friend that uses the Sennheiser MKH as a shotgun mic, and he uses that for pretty much everything he does. And he's a professional videographer. That's the one that he recommends. And again, you should go listen to our episode about microphones to learn a little more about these things and how they work. The next device you talk about is a $100 device, but this is really one of the most essential things. Other than good sound, having good lighting is really what makes video great. So you recommend this 2400-watt softbox lighting kit, which is three lights on light stands that have these huge softboxes that go around them. So a softbox is a way of diffusing the light. Why is this a recommended setup?

**Josh Byers:** Well, for one, for what you get for the price is fantastic. So, I mean, you basically get everything you need. You know, you could bring in three lamps, and I've done that before. You know, three of those, you know, clip-on lamps that you can get.

**Josh Byers:** You can definitely do that, but this just makes your production a lot less easier, eliminates a lot of the headaches. It's because you get the stands, you get the boxes, you get the lighting components as well. It does not come with light bulbs. You can obviously put your own light bulbs in there, but you can get those for pretty cheap. And then obviously the carrying case, things like that. But I do like the softbox idea for this, particularly if you're doing videos for testimonies or, you know, if you're bringing in people that aren't normally on camera, shining a harsh light in their face is fairly unnerving.

**Josh Byers:** And so if you can go the softbox route, diffuse that and still have good light, you know, rather than the nasty fluorescent overhead lights that we have in so many of our buildings. But if you can get some good light in there and then diffuse that so it's not, you know, TV camera shining bright in their face, it's going to put your subjects much more at ease. You're going to get, I think, a lot more...

**Josh Byers:** Authenticity in what they're talking about, what they're telling you. And it's going to make for a better overall production.

**Tim Hopper:** So the idea here is a three-point lighting setup, a key light, fill light, and backlight. Can you try to describe that idea? That's probably new to a lot of people who haven't done this, but it's really one of the age-old tricks in interview videography.

**Josh Byers:** You'll notice whenever you watch any type of television program, movie, interview, news, whatever, they are all lit to convey some sort of emotion. And that's really what lighting is about. It's about obviously lighting the subject, but then it's about it plays its own character as well. So if you have maybe just a single light, and you've probably seen pictures of this where half the character's face is dark, half of it's light. It's very dramatic lighting, and that's intended for dramatic moments or things like that. When you're doing interviews and testimonies, you're not necessarily looking for those dramatic moments. I suppose sometimes you might be able to, but the three-point lighting system just gives good light to all the places that you want it. You have good light on your character or your subject. As they're facing the camera, you've got a key light that then fills that in. So you don't have the sharp contrast and shadows. And then the backlight is really to break them up from the background.

**Josh Byers:** So if you have a subject that's sitting, whether there's a black background behind them or whether there's a bunch of things behind them, you don't want them to blend in because the subject of your video is the focus. And so you're able to backlight them, and that light basically separates them from the background and brings them more forward to the camera. And it just lends to a better overall production, and your viewers will appreciate that.

**Tim Hopper:** If you don't know about three-point lighting, or I guess all you know about three-point lighting is what you just heard from Josh, I highly recommend heading over to YouTube and Googling three-point lighting. You could watch YouTube videos online.

**Tim Hopper:** For probably hundreds of years on three-point lighting. I've watched many of them. And I'll try to link to some good ones in the show notes at waiting-tables.com. But this is a way to really step up your game to go from not really thinking about lighting and just like, oh, we need some lights. We'll take somebody out in the sun and just have the sun shining in their face and video them there. To having lighting on a limited budget that can really look professional if you put some thought into doing this well. One of the big challenges, I'm an amateur photographer and do little bits of video here and there, but really one of the challenges that you have to learn in photography and videography is you have to make your image or your video, show the viewer where their eyes should land. And that's, I think, one of the big things about this backlight idea. You know, I'd never really thought about using a backlight in video. Why do you want a light shining behind the person? But if you're interviewing someone, you want the person's eyes watching that to land on the person you're interviewing and not just be kind of going back and forth all over the screen because there's not a lot of contrast and it's not pointing you in the right direction. So you'll be surprised how...

**Tim Hopper:** How much you can do by putting some thought in and learning a little bit about this kind of a setup and professionalism is i think that's that's the key here you can do all these things with without this stuff but to get that professional look um and to get you know a look that people are going to respond to um the audio and the lighting is really where you can make the most improvement in any of your your videos couldn't agree more and i would actually recommend it if someone has not done any kind of video like this, we talked a little bit about phones at the beginning and phones are limited. But if you have never done any video and you're trying to get into it at your church and your ministry, I would actually recommend go buy some sort of setup where you can do a three-point lighting and maybe this $100 setup from Amazon. Go buy this Rode smart lab, the wired microphone, plug that into your smartphone, get a good lighting setup and sit somebody in a chair with a three-point lighting setup around them and practice doing your interviews on that before you really maybe even invest in this thousand dollar setup. I think you might be surprised how much mileage you could get out of the device you carry around in your pocket.

**Tim Hopper:** So two other items on your list. One is the tripod, which is you got to set your camera somewhere. So you recommend the Manfrotto BK Compact Action tripod.

**Tim Hopper:** Often video tripods are a little different from... Photo tripods, just because you might want to do slightly different things with a recording video as with photo. But this is one maybe that will serve both purposes. It's about a $60 tripod.

**Josh Byers:** Yeah, the Manfrotto, again, brand names don't mean everything, but sometimes they do. And the Manfrottos have a great reputation.

**Josh Byers:** I've bought numbers of cheap tripods. And you may say, $50, that's pretty cheap as well. But I've bought much cheaper ones than that. And you pay for it Because what happens is the legs get loose, and in the middle of your video, one of the legs starts sliding down, and it just ruins everything. So get a good, decent tripod. Again, it's not something to necessarily skimp on. You don't need to spend a ton of money. You can. You can spend a ton of money. You can. But get a decent one. And the Manfrottos have a really good reputation. And I think one of the things I like about them is that on their legs, if they do ever become loose over time, it's really easy to tighten them back up again.

**Tim Hopper:** So, and one of the, this is probably not the kind of setup you're going to be wanting to do a lot of complex panning and things with, uh, you probably just want to set up your camera in the position you want it and get it there. But, uh, the big thing you want then for a tripod like that is you need to make sure if you set your camera in a position, it's going to stay where you set it. Uh, if you're recording a clip, that's a few minutes long and your, your tripod is subtly, uh, moving, you're going to watch your clip later and realize you're, you started looking at the person's head and then you're looking at their feet.

**Tim Hopper:** It's worth spending a little bit of money in. And it's, it is really amazing how much money you can drop in a tripod, but this is a really good suggestion. The final thing you have on your list is a, an SD card. You might think this doesn't really matter. You can just go buy whatever you get at Walmart, but it turns out with high def video, uh, SD cards, it becomes important that you buy a good one. One, because you have to write quickly because it's a lot of data. And then two, because the files are so big, you need a card that's big enough to store everything. So you recommend the SanDisk Extreme 32 gig, 90 megabit per second card, which is only a $20 card.

**Josh Byers:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, compared to what storage used to be, it's pretty cheap. But yeah, like you said, make sure that it can write fast. Otherwise, the camera will stutter and you'll get artifacts in your video. And then I'll just throw this in there. Whenever you're transferring your video, I think most SD cards have this. Make sure that you have a lock switch. Anytime you're transferring it off of your cards, make sure that lock switch is on. That way the computer doesn't actually overwrite right back to your card. I've had that happen before. Lock your card, get it off your card, and then back it up as soon as possible.

**Tim Hopper:** This is great. I really like the setup. You add it all up. All this is available for $1,189 at Amazon. You may be.

**Tim Hopper:** So really just incredible the quality of video you could get out of this if you wanted to. Do you have any recommendations on sort of basic editing? Like what do you do with the video once you get it?

**Josh Byers:** Yeah, so once you have it on the camera, obviously you got to get it on the computer so you can edit it. I'm a Mac guy, so I have used Mac products for pretty much all my video editing. So iMovie is a great starter. Basically comes on every single Mac that you have. There's not a lot that you can't do in iMovie. You know, if you want to, you can step up to Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere. But really, for what's... What you're probably going to be doing at first, you don't need those. IMovie would be a great option. If you have a Windows machine or if you don't want to use iMovie on a Mac, Filmora is a good option as well. Lots of really good features, and they have lots of built-in helps and themes. So, you know, if you're not really sure where to go for some of those other look and style of your videos, that will help as well. But Filmora, you can get that at iskysoft.com. That's really hard to say fast, but iSkySoft.com is where you can get Filmora.

**Tim Hopper:** And also, I think built in with Windows is some kind of Windows movie maker or something.

**Tim Hopper:** It's worth trying. I would say I completely agree with you about iMovie. Use those free ones or included ones until you're really pushing the limits and feeling the pain of where you could be using a more professional piece of software, but don't just jump right into the professional level tools. Although, again, Final Cut Pro is used by professional video editors. People make lots of money with it.

**Tim Hopper:** And you can get it on your Mac, I think, for $300. So that's a lot of money, but it's not like it used to be. It's just really amazing.

**Josh Byers:** Well, and what's interesting about Final Cut Pro is they redesigned it a couple years ago to act more like iMovie. So if you've used iMovie before, you may actually be surprised at how easy Final Cut Pro is to use. They act very similar obviously gives you a lot more powerful features but yeah it's a great great prices as well and if you used Final Cut Pro before that change you still haven't forgiven Apple for it probably is my understanding.

**Tim Hopper:** Some people are not happy about that Josh does your church have Like a YouTube channel or examples of where people could see some of the work that you've done? Or are those only used internally?

**Josh Byers:** Yeah, no, you do. In fact, we actually changed our church name a couple months ago to Soteria Des Moines. So our old website, creekchurch.com, is still up, but soteriaDSM.com is our new site. And if you go to the media link there, you can have access to all of our sermons. We have our life stories as well. So you can see some of those different things. If you search on YouTube, Soteria Des Moines, you'll find our YouTube channel where we have a number of our stories, life stories or people that we've recorded as well as our sermons. Now, we just started recording our sermons a couple of years or actually, I should say a couple of months ago.

**Josh Byers:** So we're kind of still wading through the shallow end on that aspect, but we've been doing stories and that for quite a while. So for the aspects and for the components that we've been talking about here, they are more appropriate for recording testimonies and interviews and things like that. So, yeah, you can find those in our YouTube channel or on our new website, SoteriaDSM.com.

**Tim Hopper:** I would not encourage people to go out and just try to copy someone else exactly, but there's a lot of value in taking inspiration from other people who are doing these things and watching videos to start to know what to look for. What are the things that make this seem so...

**Tim Hopper:** Uh, good. I'm just noticing on your site, one of the things you do is that you have a very simple scene when you're doing these interviews with people there, maybe in a chair with a dark background behind them, but you don't have a lot of distraction and clutter in the video. The focus is the story.

**Josh Byers:** So, you know, and we, there's a

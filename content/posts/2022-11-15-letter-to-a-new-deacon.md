*The following is a letter I wrote to a friend on the occasion of his ordination to the office of deacon.*

Congratulations on your ordination to deacon earlier this year. Serving Christ in this office has been one of my greatest joys in the past ten years. I pray you'll know this joy as you get to die to yourself and live to Christ.

Deacons get to love the LORD in heart, Soul, and Mind as they labor to free their elders for the work of preaching and praying, and they get to love their neighbor as guard the sheep from the trials of poverty, loneliness and sickness. In a way, this is an office of the greatest commandments.

A hundred years ago, [RC Reed](https://reformeddeacon.com/the-deacon/) said a good deacon must be "one who can be Patient, who can smile at unreasonable people, and speak a soft word to turn away wrath, one who is willing to give time and take trouble on himself, and make himself 'all thing[s] to all men' in order to promote the interests of his Master's Cause." Reed points toward a special power deacons seem to have and that power is promoting peace in the congregation. I have seen this in action (and hopefully contributed to it), and I encourage you to cherish this power and actively employ it to the good of your congregation.

If you are a deacon who serves not for your own glory but for Christ's, who daily dies to sin, who loves the saints in deed, and who sits attentively at your Master's feet, you will be a blessed deacon indeed. In this, you will gain a great confidence in the faith and a good standing for yourself.

To the end

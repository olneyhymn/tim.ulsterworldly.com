Behind the scenes of every church are volunteers and staff members helping maintain the finances, update the websites, and schedule the nursery workers.

Waiting Tables is a new podcast that explores the behind-the-scenes of the life and operation of a church. It exists to help ease these logistical hurdles to free you and your church to focus on its mission.

We will have episodes about buildings, bookkeeping, websites, security, advertising, volunteer scheduling, communications, sermon recording, and more. The podcast will feature interviews with church leaders about the ins-and-outs of their work, interviews with the creators of tools designed to help churches, and deep dives into church challenges and ways to solve them.

Are you a pastor, church leader, volunteer coordinator, or just a member looking to serve more effectively? This biweekly podcast is for you.

## 2 Kings 6:1-17 (ESV)


> 1 Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See, the place where we dwell under your
> charge is too small for us. 2 Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log,
> and let us make a place for us to dwell there.” And he answered, “Go.” 3 Then one of
> them said, “Be pleased to go with your servants.” And he answered, “I will go.” 4 So
> he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. 5 But as one
> was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water, and he cried out, “Alas, my
> master! It was borrowed.” 6 Then the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” When he
> showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron
> float. 7 And he said, “Take it up.” So he reached out his hand and took it.
>
> 8 Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his
> servants, saying, “At such and such a place shall be my camp.” 9 But the man of God
> sent word to the king of Israel, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the
> Syrians are going down there.” 10 And the king of Israel sent to the place about which
> the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more
> than once or twice.
>
> 11 And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing, and
> he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me who of us is for the
> king of Israel?” 12 And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Elisha,
> the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in
> your bedroom.” 13 And he said, “Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize
> him.” It was told him, “Behold, he is in Dothan.” 14 So he sent there horses and
> chariots and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.
>
> 15 When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold,
> an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, “Alas,
> my master! What shall we do?” 16 He said, “Do not be afraid, for those who are with us
> are more than those who are with them.” 17 Then Elisha prayed and said, “O Lord,
> please open his eyes that he may see.” So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man,
> and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all
> around Elisha.


### I. Introduction: Historical Context


* Setting: Northern Kingdom of Israel possibly during the reign of King Jehoram (c.
  850--840 BC).
* Threat: Israel faced constant border threats from Aram-Damascus possibly under King
  Ben-Hadad II.
* Condition of Israel: 


  * Spiritually compromised
  * Politically unstable
  * Militarily vulnerable
* Prophetic Role: Elisha served not only as a prophet but as divine
  intelligence--forewarning Israel of Aram's attacks.
* Dothan Incident: Aram sends a covert force to capture Elisha, viewing him as a
  strategic threat.


### II. The Story (vv. 8--23)


1. Elisha Foils Syrian Plans (vv. 8--12)


   * Elisha warns Israel multiple times.
   * King of Syria is frustrated: "Who is the traitor?"
   * His servant says: "Elisha…tells the king of Israel the words you speak in your
     bedroom."
2. Syrian Army Surrounds Dothan (vv. 13--15)


   * Elisha's servant wakes up to see an army encircling them.
   * In fear, he cries: "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"
3. Elisha's Response and Prayer (vv. 16--17)


   * "Fear not, for they that be with us are more than they that be with them."
   * Elisha prays: "Lord, open his eyes that he may see."
   * The servant sees chariots of fire surrounding Elisha.


### III. Reflections and Applications


#### 1. The Spiritual Realm Is More Real Than We Realize


* The servant needed eyes of faith--not better circumstances, but clearer sight.
* Spurgeon:


  > THE believer in Christ sees much more than any other man sees. There is a proverb
  > which says, "Seeing is believing;" but that is not true, for there are many
  > things that we see, which, if we are sensible persons, we shall not believe,
  > since our eyes are very apt indeed to be deceived, and optical illusions are very
  > common. If you turn the proverb round the other way, and say, "Believing is
  > seeing," you will often find it come true. The man who has believed has "the
  > evidence of things not seen" as yet; he is like Moses, who is described as
  > "seeing him who is invisible."
* Our modern world preaches empiricism and materialism.
* We are taught to trust our senses and our experiences.
* But the Bible teaches that our spiritual eyes are more important than our physical
  eyes.
* We need to pray for eyes to see.


#### 2. God's Protection Is Real and Mighty--Even When Invisible


* "They that are with us are more than they that are with them."


  * How true this is!
  * Psalm 91 promises "He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all
    your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your
    foot against a stone."
* Even with Israel was in decline, but God still watched over His people.
* Dale Ralph Davis notes this was written to the people in exile 300 years later


  * They probably did not see the chariots of fire!
  * Davis:


  > Of course, the experience of Jesus instructs us that the unseen protection is
  > present even if it is not 'activated'. Jesus rebuked Peter in Gethsemane with 'Or
  > do you think I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal
  > more than twelve legions of angels?' (Matt. 26:53, NASB). Imagine--there were
  > 72,000 mighty spirits chomping at the bit to intervene in Jesus' defense. But the
  > legions were idle because the cross was the will of God. But in Gethsemane it was
  > as if Jesus turns and says quietly, 'Peter, I don't lack resources.' Which means
  > that Jesus knew and lived under the unseen protection of 2 Kings 6:8--23. 

* Calvin said there's no value in knowing that we have one angel as a special
  guardian when we have the host of heaven watching over us.

 
  > If any one does not think it enough to know that all the orders of the
  > heavenly host are perpetually watching for his safety, I do not see what he
  > could gain by knowing that he has one angel as a special guardian. Those,
  > again, who limit the care which God takes of each of us to a single angel,
  > do great injury to themselves and to all the members of the Church, as if
  > there were no value in those promises of auxiliary troops, who on every side
  > encircling and defending us, embolden us to fight more manfully.


#### 3. Fear Not--God Acts


* Elisha's servant was afraid.
* But Elisha was not afraid.
* Why? 
* Spurgeon:


  > And his servant said unto him, Alas, my Master! What shall we do? That is a
  > question we have often asked, "What shall we do?" We shall do nothing at all!
  > What shall we do? If that were the question, we might sit down in despair! The
  > proper question is, "What will God do? How will God deliver us?"
* We must preach to ourselves the truth of God's care and protection.


  * Matthew Henry: "When we are magnifying the causes of our fear we ought to possess
    ourselves with clear, and great, and high thoughts of God and the invisible world.
    If God be for us, we know what follows, Rom. 8:31."
* Ultimately God's care is shown in that he conquered his and our enemies not with a
  mighty host, but the Savior on the cross (Col. 2:15).


  > He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.


#### 4. The Power of Intercessory Prayer


* Elisha prays for others three times in 2 Kings 6: for sight, for blindness, and again for mercy.
* C.H. Irwin:


  > Elisha's prayers prevailed three times in this short narrative. There may be some
  > one known to us whose eyes are closed, who is spiritually blind. Have we brought
  > the case to God in prayer? Is it a wandering son? "Lord, I pray thee, open his
  > eyes, that he may see." Is it a wayward daughter? a godless friend? We may not
  > reach them by our words; but we can reach them by our prayers. 
* Prayer can do what persuasion cannot.
* Matthew Henry: "The greatest kindness we can do for those that are fearful and
  faint-hearted is to pray for them, and so to recommend them to the mighty grace of
  God."


### IV. Closing Charge


* When you feel surrounded, pray not just for rescue--but for sight.
* Don't measure your situation by what is visible. "We walk by faith, not by sight."
* Believe, then you will see.
* When others are afraid, pray for them. When we cannot reach them with our words, we
  can reach them with our prayers.
* And when God opens your eyes, open your hands--to pray, to show mercy, to trust.
